The workbook follows the textbook on a chapter-by-chapter basis. The workbook has three sections for each chapter:\n\nReading questions designed to be approachable to a person who has read the chapter for the first time and is able to use the chapter as a reference. A few reading questions ask for calculations, but most are about the relationship between concepts. Attempting the reading questions will help guide you on a second reading of the textbook chapter. Multiple-choice reading questions provide instant feedback. This isn’t to help you find the correct answer but to help you better understand the question.\nReview questions are typically at a more technical level than the reading questions. They are useful for checking your progress after a second reading of the chapter, or reviewing concepts at the end of a Block or before an exam. (Your instructor won’t necessarily pose exam questions based on the review questions!) All review questions are configured to give instant feedback to help you distinguish between topic you have already mastered and those for which gaining mastery is still a work in progress. Many review questions provide formative feedback in response to a wrong choice.\nA primary purpose of Exercises is to guide you to spend “time on task” studying a topic. Reading and re-reading chapters is a good start to learning, but reinforcement comes from attempting to answer questions. Sometimes feedback is provided, often for the first question in a series to help orient you to what the exercise is about.\n\nIn many chapters, some of the exercises are denoted as “Activities.” Some of the activities can make good in-class group work. Others provide opportunity for a more open-ended approach, or are meant to prompt discussion either in class or in a study group. Only occasional feedback is provided.\nYou will encounter three main types of interactive components among the questions and exercises. First, interactive computing is built in to each document using an “active R chunk” environment that runs in the browser. This means that you do not need to install any software (other than your browser!) to be able to work the computations. Active R chunk 1 is an example. Take note that when you first load a chapter or sub-chapter, the browser will do some work which will take a minute or so (for those with suitable internet connectivity). After the first such experience, the process will generally be faster the next time and you may eventually not even notice the delay.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nTry editing the contents of Active R chunk 1, perhaps to change the color to magenta. Beginners are prone to making mistakes in writing R expressions; stick with it and you’ll get better, especially as the syntax becomes more familiar.\nAnother interactive feature of this workbook is multiple-choice questions like Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it when the sky first starts to brighten?\n\n\n sunrise        sunset        noon       \n\nquestion id: index-question-1\n\n\n\n\nIn many questions, one or more textboxes is provided, like this:\n\nThe following is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO NOTE.\nFor many purposes, e.g. reviewing or handing in your work, you will want to save a document with the contents of your active R chunks, your essays, or your multiple-choice selections. There are two ways to do this.\n\nPrint the contents of your browser tab to a PDF format. This will capture the appearance of the entire section. You may want to store the resulting PDF file on your own computer, or upload it to an instructor’s portal for grading. So long as you don’t print the PDF to paper, the environmental consequences of the print-to-PDF method are inconsequential.\nUse the “collect your answers” button at the bottom of each sub-chapter. This will place a text string in your clipboard with the contents of your active R chunks, multiple choice answers and essays. Now comes the important part: What to do with the string that is now in your clipboard?\n\n\nSubmit the string on a web portal provided by your instructor. Many course-support software systems provide a mechanism for this. The string is in a hard-for-a-human-to-read format, but it can readily be processed by software by your instructor. The system for collecting and processing is powered by a author-oriented R package called {devoirs}. In many circumstances, the instructor may find it advantageous to set up a portal using generic facilities such as a Google Forms document. (Instructors: See the {devoirs} package documentation.)\n\nindex.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Particularly when mathematical formulas are involved, commands are similar across many computer languages, so what you learn will be applicable to any other languages such as Python or MATLAB.\nThe first high-level computer language was FORTRAN, released in 1957. The name stands for “formula translation.” FORTRAN enabled arithmetic operations to be written in a way very nearly that of traditional notation. Until then, computer programs were written using alpha-numeric codes that were meaningless to a casual reader. We unfortunately still use the term “computer code” to refer to programs, despite 70-years progress in improving legibility.\nThe best way to learn to implement mathematical formulas in a computer language is to read examples and practice writing them.\nHere are some examples:\n\n\n\nTraditional notation\nR notation\n\n\n\n\n\\(3 + 2\\)\n3 + 2\n\n\n\\(3 \\div 2\\)\n3 / 2\n\n\n\\(6 \\times 4\\)\n6 * 4\n\n\n\\(\\sqrt{\\strut4}\\)\nsqrt(4)\n\n\n\\(\\ln 5\\)\nlog(5)\n\n\n\\(2 \\pi\\)\n2 * pi\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} 17\\)\n(1 / 2) * 17\n\n\n\\(17 - 5 \\div 2\\)\n17 - 5 / 2\n\n\n\\(\\frac{17 - 5}{\\strut 2}\\)\n(17 - 5) / 2\n\n\n\\(3^2\\)\n3^2\n\n\n\\(e^{-2}\\)\nexp(-2)\n\n\n\nEach of these examples has been written using numbers as inputs to the mathematical operations. The syntax will be the same when using an input name such as x or y or altitude, for instance (x - y) / 2. In order for that command using x and y to work, some meaning must have been previously attached to the symbols. We will come back to this important topic on another day.\nRead through the above table of examples several times. Note down any that you find at all confusing. Then cover up the right side of the table and write down the R expression for each item on the left side. Similarly, cover up the left side of the table and translate the R expression into traditional notation.\nUse Active R chunk 1 to write and run the R expression for each of these traditional-notation expressions. We give the numerical result for each of the traditional expressions to let you confirm that your R version is correct.\n\n\\((16 - 3)/2\\) gives result 6.5\n\\(\\sqrt{\\frac{19}{3}}\\) gives 2.5166115\n\\(\\cos(\\frac{2 \\pi}{3})\\) gives -0.5\n\\(\\pi^3 + 2\\) gives 33.0062767\n\\(\\pi^{3+2}\\) gives 306.0196848\n\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nOnce you have a grasp of how to render traditional-notation formulas into R, read these few principles to help consolidate your understanding.\n\nComputer languages generally, and R in particular, involve expressions that are written in a typewriter format: one conventional character after another in a straight line. There are no superscripts or subscripts used. So, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) will be written 1/3. The equivalent of \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) is sqrt(7).\nParentheses:\n\nWhen an opening parenthesis directly follows a name, as in sqrt(, it means that the named operation is to be applied to the quantity inside the parentheses. So sqrt(7) means “take the square root of 7” and log(10) means “take the (natural) logarithm of 10.” The common mathematical functions typically take only one input. We will stick with those for now.\nWhen an opening parenthesis does not directly follow a name, as in 6 - (2+3), the parentheses stand for grouping in the same way as in traditional notation. For instance, \\((6 + 15) / 3\\) is translated as (6 + 15) / 3.\n\nMultiplication and exponentiation are often written traditionally in terms of the relative position of quantities. So \\((3 + 2)\\pi\\) means to multiply 5 times \\(\\pi\\), even though there is no multiplication sign being written. Similar, \\(\\pi^{3 + 2}\\) means to raise \\(\\pi\\) to the fifth power. There is no “exponentiation sign” used, just the positioning of \\(3+2\\) as a superscript: \\(^{3+2}\\). In R (and almost every computer language) multiplication and exponentiation must be written explicitly. The quantities \\((3 + 2)\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi^{3 + 2}\\) would be translated as (3 + 2) * pi and pi^(3+2).\n\nOne additional note: All these examples can be written with a single line of code, as is true for many short formulas. Later on, we will encounter longer formulas that could be written on a single line but are more readable when spread over two or more consecutive lines.\n\n\nExercise 3 Use the MOSAIC Calculus naming conventions to answer these questions.\n\nWhat is \\(h()\\)?\n\n\n\n The name of a function\n\n\n The name of an input.\n\n\n A specific numerical value\n\n\n\nquestion id: convention-drill-1\n\n\n\nHow come we write \\(f()\\) for the name of a function rather than just \\(f\\) or \\(f(x)\\)?\n\n\n\n No good reason\n\n\n It is a reminder that we are talking about a function with the name “\\(f\\)”.\n\n\n The parentheses are part of the name.\n\n\n\nquestion id: convention-drill-2\n\n\n\nWhat sort of thing is denoted by \\(x_0\\) or \\(y_\\star\\) or \\(y_{max}\\)?\n\n\n\n A particular numerical value\n\n\n The name of an input\n\n\n\nquestion id: convention-drill-3\n\n\n\nWhich of these symbols might stand for the entire domain of a function?\n\n\n\n \\(y\\)\n\n\n \\(f()\\)\n\n\n \\(y_0\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: convention-drill-4\n\n\n\nSuppose you come across \\(v(w) \\equiv w + 3\\) in this book. What do \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) stand for?\n\n\n\n \\(v()\\) is the name of a function and \\(w\\) is the name of the input to that function.\n\n\n It is meaningless.\n\n\n It is the same thing as \\(v = w + 3\\).\n\n\n\nquestion id: convention-drill-5\n\n\n\nAre \\(g(x) \\equiv x^2\\) and \\(h(w) \\equiv w^2\\) the same function?\n\n\n\n Yes, although that function is being given two different names.\n\n\n Of course not!\n\n\n\nquestion id: convention-drill-6\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 When your R command is not a complete sentence, the R output will contain an error like this:\n\\[\\color{red}{\\mathtt{Error\\  in\\ parse(text = x, keep.source = TRUE) : &lt;text&gt;:5:0:\\\\ unexpected\\  end\\  of\\ input}}\\]\nThe “unexpected end of input” is the computer’s way of saying, “You haven’t finished your sentence so I don’t know what to do.”\nEach of the following R expressions is incomplete. Your job, which you should do in one line after another in @dolphin-toss-candy, is to turn each into a complete expression that produces a numerical result. Sometimes you will have to be creative, since when a sentence is incomplete you, like the computer, don’t really know what it means to say! But each of these erroneous expressions can be fixed by adding or changing text. Note: In the end, your R chunk will have seven commands, each on its own line.\n\nsin 3\n((16 - 4) + (14 + 2) / sqrt(7) where it is intended that the division be applied to the entire preceeding statement.\npnorm(3; mean=2, sd=4)\nlog[7]\n14(3 + 7)\ne^2\n3 + 4 x + 2 x^2\n\nThe last command will generate an error, because no value was assigned to x before asking R to compute with it. You can ignore that last error.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Here is an R chunk that evaluates a function at an input \\(x\\):\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 3\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nIn the following questions, numbers have been rounded to two or three significant digits.

This scale was selected automatically by slice_plot() because the function itself does not give any context for what the vertical scale should be. You can set the vertical scale manually by piping the graphics command into this expression, gf_lims(y = c(0, 20)). Make this change to the R-chunk and verify that the scale is indeed what is indicated.\n\n\n\nExercise 7 The function f() produced by doodle_fun() has two inputs. A contour plot is an appropriate way to visualize the function. In this exercise, you’re going to play with the location of contours.

It has other properties that are related to the sides and each other, for example, the angles between sides, the perimeter, or the area enclosed by the triangle.\nHere’s a description of the relationship between the perimeter \\(p\\) and the lengths of the sides, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), written in the form of a function: \\[p(a,b,c) \\equiv a + b + c\\ .\\] The mathematical expression of the relationship between area \\(A\\) enclosed by the triangle and the side lengths goes back at least 2000 years to Heron of Alexandria (circa 10–70). As a function, it can be written \\[A(a,b,c) \\equiv \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{\\strut 4a^2b^2-(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2}\\ .\\]\nWe cannot readily plot out this function because there are three inputs and one output, and it is impossible to draw in a 4-dimensional space . But we can draw a slice through the 4-dimensional space.\nLet’s do that by setting, say, \\(a=3\\) and looking at the area as a function of the lengths of sides \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nNot all of the graphics frame is shaded.

Instead, we may be interested in how steep the function is at a point, which is indicated by the spacing between contours. When contours are closely spaced, the hillside is steep. Where contours are far apart, the hillside is not steep, perhaps even locally flat.\nAnother common task for interpreting contour plots is to locate the input pair that is at a local high point or low point: the top of a hill or the bottom of a hollow. Such points are called local argmax or local argmin respectively.  The output of the function at a local argmax is called the local maximum; similarly for a local argmin, where the output is called a local minimum.The word “argmax” is a contraction of “argument of the maximum.” We will tend to use the word “input” instead of “argument”, but it means the same thing to say “the inputs to a function” as saying “the arguments of a function.”\nAnswer the following questions For the function shown in Figure 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The function for Exercise 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind an input coordinate where the function is steepest.\nFind input coordinates for the high and low points of the function .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer for Exercise 14\n\n\n\n\n\nA function is steepest where contour lines are spaced closely together, that is, where the function output changes a lot with a small change in input. This is true near inputs \\((x=0, y=1)\\). But notice that steepness involves a direction. Near \\((x=0,y=1)\\), changing the \\(x\\) value does not lead to a big change in output, but a small change in the value of \\(y\\) leads to a big change in output. In other words, the function is steep in the y-direction but not in the x-direction.\nThe highest output value explicitly marked in the graph is 8. We can imagine from the shapes of the contours surrounding the 8 contour that the function reaches a peak somewhere in the middle of the region enclosed by the 8 contour, near the input coordinate \\((x=0, y=-1.5)\\).\nSimilarly, the lowest output value marked is -10. In the middle of the area enclosed by the -10 contour is a local low point. That there are two such regions, one centered near input coordinate \\((x=-0.5, y=3.3)\\), the other at \\((x=1.5, y=3.1)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 15 Consider this interactive contour plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind a value for the (x, y) inputs where the function output is about -0.35.\n\n\n\nFind a value for the (x, y) inputs where the function output is about 0.9.\n\n\n\nOne contour goes through the input A=(x=1.53, y=1.59). The neighboring contour goes through B=(x=1.53, y=0.90).\n\nWhat is the function output half-way between these two points, at input C=(x=1.53, y=1.25)?\nHow does the output at C relate to the output at A and B?\n\n\n\n\nChoose one of the contours and track the output value (called “z” by the display) as you move the cursor along that contour.

When an input is outside of the domain of the function, the function value is undefined. This “undefined” value is represented by a special “number,” which has no value. The special “number” is written NaN standing for “not a number.”\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 3\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Active R chunk 3, do some experimental arithmetic with NaN, for instance, adding 5 or multiplying by 3, and so on.

The domain of both functions encompasses your whole life span. It’s reasonable to consider each of these functions to be continuous.

For convenience, it also draws a horizontal line corresponding to zero on the vertical axis.

Here, you will be looking for zero-crossings: the neighborhood of a point in the function’s domain where the output of the function is negative for inputs on one side and positive for inputs on the other side. If zero is touched but not crossed, we will call that “touched zero.”\nThe table below lists the pattern-book functions. For each function in the list, fill in the table. That is, say whether the function crosses zero, touches zero but does not cross, or does not touch at all in the part of the domain shown in the graphic: \\(-3 \\leq x \\leq 3\\). Also note if the value of the function appears to be reaching a horizontal asymptote at zero for very negative \\(x\\), for very positive \\(x\\), for both, or neither.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction name\nR formula\nzero in domain shown in graph\nasymptotic zero\n\n\n\n\nexponential\nexp(x)\nno zeros\nfor very negative \\(x\\)\n\n\nlogarithm\n\n\n\n\n\nsinusoid\n\n\n\n\n\nsquare\n\n\n\n\n\nproportional\n\n\n\n\n\nconstant\n\n\n\n\n\nreciprocal\n\n\n\n\n\ngaussian\n\n\n\n\n\nsigmoid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

The proportion of smartphone owners grew exponentially during the early 2000’s. As the number of smartphones increased, the broader familiarity with smartphone advertisements also increased, which helped sustain this exponential growth. However, adoption has slowed as smartphone penetration reaches the maximum carrying capacity. In other words, once everyone has a smartphone, the proportion of smartphone owners cannot increase—everyone already owns a smartphone. So, eventually the exponential growth must taper-off. According to several datasets, this inflection point occurred sometime between 2013 and 2014. This behavior is visible in the graphic below showing US smartphone penetration between Jan 2005 and Oct 2020 with raw data shown from 2010 to 2015.\n\nDuring the initial, exponential phase of smartphone penetration, what was the doubling time for penetration?

Let’s estimate the standard deviation for males. To do this, start at the peak of the male distribution. The output value at the peak is \\(0.1329\\). Find the output value that is 60% of this peak value. We’re looking for the value \\[0.1329(0.6)=0.0797\\approx0.08\\] on the output (vertical) axis. Now, measure the half the width (i.e. along the horizontal axis) of the Gaussian along the line \\[y=0.08\\]. This is the standard deviation.\n\nWhich of these is the best estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution of heights for males?\n\n\n 3 inches        6 inches        7 inches        8 inches       \n\nquestion id: squirrel-toss-glasses-3\n\n\n\nThe female height distribution has a mean of 64.5 and standard deviation of 2.5.

However, a study found that some of the alcohol remains: 25% after 1 hour of baking or simmering, and 10% after 2 hours.\n\nThe modeler’s go-to function type for events like the evaporation of alcohol is exponential: The amount of alcohol that evaporates in one hour would, under constant conditions (e.g. an oven’s heat), be proportional to the amount of alcohol present at the beginning of the hour.\n\nAssume that 25% of the alcohol remains after 1 hour? If the process were exponential, how much would remain after 2 hours?\n\n\n 10%        25%        25% of 25%        75%        75% of 75%       \n\nquestion id: cow-type-kayak-1\n\n\n\nWhat is the half-life of an exponential process that decays to 25% after one hour?\n\n\n 15 minutes        30 minutes        45 minutes        none of the above       \n\nquestion id: cow-type-kayak-2\n\n\nLet’s change pace and think about the “10% after 2 hours” observation. First, recall that the amount left after \\(n\\) halvings is \\(\\text{amount.left}(n) \\equiv \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\Large n}\\) This is an exponential function with base 1/2.\nYou’re going to carry out a guess-and-check procedure to find \\(n\\) that gives \\(\\text{amount.left}(n) = 0.10\\).\nActive R chunk 2 includes the definition of the amount.left() function. We start with a guess of \\(n=10\\), which is wrong. Change the guess until you get the output 10%.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nUse amount.left() as defined in the scaffolding to guess-and-check how many halvings it takes to bring something down to 10% of the original amount.\n\n\n 2.58        3.32        3.62        3.94        4.12       \n\nquestion id: cow-type-kayak-3\n\n\n\nThe answer you got in part C) is the number of halvings needed to reach 10%.

This phenomenon has come to be known as the Yerkes-Dodson Stress Performance Curve, and you’ve probably experienced this yourself.

This means the graph of the function looks the same even when plotted on very different horizontal and vertical axes. The function \\(\\ln(x)\\) plotted on two different scales in Figure 5 shows that the graph of the function has practically the same shape on either scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The logarithm function has the same overall shape even when plotted on domains of very different scales.\n\n\n\nFigure 6 shows a power-law function, \\(g(x) \\equiv x^2\\), which is also scale invariant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The function \\(x^2\\) shown on two very different domain scales has the same overall shape.\n\n\n\nOther pattern-book functions are not scale invariant, for example \\(\\sin(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The \\(\\sin( )\\) function is not scale invariant.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to scale-invariant functions, some of our pattern-book functions have a characteristic scale. This is a domain length over which the whole of a characteristic feature of the function is evident. Graphing on larger domains simply squashes down the characteristic feature to a small part of the graphic domain. For instance, in the \\(\\sin()\\) function the cycle is a characteristic feature. The cycle in the pattern-book sinusoid has a characteristic length of \\(2 \\pi\\), the length of the cycle. Consequently, the graph looks different depending on the length of the graphics domain in multiples of the characteristic length. You can see from Figure 7 that the graph on the domain \\(-10 &lt; x &lt; 10\\), that is, about 3 times the characteristic scale, looks different from the graph on the larger domain that has a length 30 times the characteristic scale.\nThe output of the sigmoid function runs from 0 to 1 but reaches these values only asymptotically, as \\(x \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty\\). In defining a characteristic scale, it would be reasonable to look at the length of the domain that takes the output from, say, 0.01 to 0.99. In other words, we want the characteristic scale to be defined in a way that captures almost all the action in the output of the function. For a gaussian, a reasonable definition of a characteristic scale would be the length of domain where the output falls to about, say, 1% of its peak output.\n\nThe gaussian (bump) function dnorm() has a characteristic scale. Which of these is a domain length that can encompass the characteristic shape of the gaussian?\n\n\n 0.1        1        6        16        256       \n\nquestion id: bear-lay-plant-1\n\n\n\nThe sigmoid function pnorm() also has a characteristic scale. Which of these is a domain length that can encompass the characteristic shape of the sigmoid?\n\n\n 0.1        1        6        16        256       \n\nquestion id: bear-lay-plant-2\n\n\nThroughout science, it is common to set a standard approach to defining a characteristic scale. For instance, the characteristic scale of an aircraft could be taken as the length of body. Gaussian and sigmoids are so common throughout science that there is a convention for defining the characteristic scale called the standard deviation. For the pattern book gaussian and sigmoid, the standard deviation is 1. That is much shorter than the domain that captures the bulk of action of the gaussian or sigmoid. For this reason, statisticians in practice use a characteristic scale of \\(\\pm 2\\) or \\(\\pm 3\\) standard deviations.\n\n08-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

You probably know how it goes. You go to the pharmacy to pick up a bottle of pills. There might be anywhere between 10 pills and 40. The directions will certainly tell you to make sure to finish the bottle; to take the full course of medication. It may say take a pill twice a day, or three times, or every six hours, perhaps with food.\nThe details of this regimen are determined largely by the details of whether food inhibits or buffers absorption of the medicine and by the efficiency by which your body metabolizes the medicine and then removes it from your blood via your liver.\nModeling this process—often called the pharmacokinetics of the drug—is an important step in drug development. A simple but effective model of the drug concentration over time is a piecewise function: zero before you take the pill, then an exponential decay from an initial level of one unit after you take the pill.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 3\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nThe shape of the pill() function is seen in Figure 4. Another part of the model is the therapeutic threshold, the minimal concentration for medical effectiveness. Keep in mind that this is a model. In reality, the drug not is absorbed instantaneously as in the model, and the medical effectiveness varies smoothly with concentration rather than being an all-or-nothing affair.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 101 rows.\nℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n  a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A simple illustrative model of drug availability from taking a unit dose at time zero. The therapeutic threshold depends on the drug: 0.25 is shown here. (The gf_text() function adds a label to the plot. You aren’t expected to master label making.)\n\n\n\nThe critical features of the model are the half-life of the drug in the body and the therapeutic threshold, both of which depend on the particular drug in question.\n\nWhat is the half life of the drug depicted in the Figure 4?\n\n\n 60 minutes        90 minutes        120 minutes        180 minutes       \n\nquestion id: goat-walk-window-1\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the availability from a single pill. The goal of taking multiple pills, spread out over time, is to keep the drug availability above the therapeutic threshold for an extended time, e.g. 10 days. There are three parameters to the therapy: how often you take a pill, and the dose delivered by a single pill, and the medicine’s half-life.\n\nOccasionally, the prescription directs you to take a single pill once a day. Suppose the half-life of the medicine is 3 hours.

The standard deviations are 17 cm and 22 cm respectively. A good model for the person-to-person variation for females is dnorm(height, mean = 157, sd = 17) and similarly for males.\nTo see the overall distribution of adult height, regardless of sex, make a linear combination of the distribution for females and for males, giving each a scalar of one-half (since the population is roughly 50-50 female/male).\nIn Active R chunk 6, construct the linear combination function for the overall distribution. Use the scaffolding to plot out the distributions for the individual sexes and the overall distribution.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 6\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nSome people erroneously think that since the mean height of men is larger than women by 10cm, you can readily distinguish between the sexes based on height. However, notice that the overall distribution (plotted in black) does not show a dip between the sexes: there is no clear separation based on height.\nAs a thought experiment, let’s increase the separation in mean height from the actual value of \\(167-157=10\\) cm to something larger. You can increase the separation by 5 cm, for example, by making the men’s mean height 167+5.\nWhat’s the smallest increase in separation (in cm) that produces a barely visible dip between the sexes in the overall height distribution?\n\n 5        10        15        20        25        30       \n\nquestion id: tg4\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14 The data points in Active R chunk 7 were collected by astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) and used by Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) to develop his theory of the motion of planets.

The vertical axis is in kilowatts (power). The overall pattern for June 4 is a bump function with a peak around 13:00 falling to zero at 6am and 9pm. (13:00 is roughly solar noon, due to daylight savings time.) We’ll call this function sun(t). June 3 shows a more complex pattern, due to passing clouds that diminish the available sunlight.\nA reasonable model for the June 3 pattern is the bump function sun(t) multiplied by an irregular function of time representing the clouds. Let’s call it cloudiness(t), imagining that the range is from 0 (dark, obscuring clouds) to 1 (no clouds at all). The power produced is therefore\npower(t) \\(\\equiv\\) solar(t) \\(\\times\\) cloudiness(t)\nRefering to Figure 16, sketch out the graph of cloudiness(t) for June 3.\n\n09-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

A key function is fitModel(), which like makeFun(), constructs a function. And, like makeFun(), you need to use a tilde expression to specify the model formula. But, unlike makeFun(), you can leave it to the computer to find the parameters that will make the function align with data.\nTo illustrate, we can construct a housing-price model from the SaratogaHouses data:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that in applying the price() function to inputs, we are using the names of the inputs explicitly. To write the command price(2000,3,2) risks mixing up which input is which.\nUse the function in the ordinary way. For instance, here is what the model has to say about the anticipated sales price of a house with 2000 square feet of living area, three bedrooms, and two bathrooms.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor technical reasons, the functions created by fitModel() have a lot of computer-programming jargon in them, as you can see by constructing the model itself and then looking at the function. But you will also see the values of the parameters found by fitModel().\n\n\nClass activity\n\nExercise 5 Auckland, New Zealand is in a field of dormant volcanos. The highest, at 193 meters above sea level, is Maungawhau. Formerly, tourists could drive to the peak and look down into the crater, as seen in the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Panoramic photo of the crater of Maungawhau, near Auckland, New Zealand. Source\n\n\n\nThe initial creator of R, Ross Ihaka, teaches at the University of Auckland. His digitization of a topographic map is easily plotted, as here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A combination surface and contour plot of the topography of Maungawhau.\n\n\n\nThe z-axis is height and is in meters. The x- and y-axes are latitude and longitude, measured in 10-meter units from a reference point. (So, \\(x=10\\) is 100 meters from \\(x=20\\).)\nGet used to the presentation of the surface plot and how to rotate it and zoom in. To see the crater more clearly, you can rotate the surface plot to look straight downwards, effectively presenting you with a color-coded contour plot. Moving the cursor over the surface will display the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates, as well as the \\(z\\)-value at that coordinate point.\n\nWhat is the \\((x, y)\\) location of the low-point of the crater? (Choose the closest answer.)\n\n\n \\((x=34, y=29)\\)        \\((x=31, y=25)\\)        \\((x=25, y=34)\\)        \\((x=29, y=34)\\)       \n\nquestion id: crater-location\n\n\n\nWhat color is used to designate the lowest elevations?\n\n\n dark blue        green        yellow       \n\nquestion id: crater-color\n\n\nIf you were to climb up Maungawhau, at some point you would be at the same elevation as the low-point of the crater, even though you are outside the crater. Think of the contour that corresponds to that elevation. Let’s call it the “half-way” contour since it is roughly half-way up the volcano.\n\nWhat is the shape of the “half-way” contour?\n\n\n a line segment        a crescent        a closed curve        a cross       \n\nquestion id: crater-contour\n\n\nImagine that you are filling up the crater with water. At some point, the water rises to a level where it will spill over the lip of the crater.\n\nWhat is the elevation at which the water will start to spill over the crater lip? (Pick the closest answer.)\n\n\n 169 meters        172 meters        175 meters        178 meters       \n\nquestion id: crater-lip\n\n\n\nExplain in terms of the shapes of contours how you can identify the elevation at which the water would spill over the rim.\n\n\n\n10-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

More properly, the expression should be written \\[\\left(\\frac{M}{1\\  kg}\\right)^{2/3}\\] The division by “1 kg” renders dimensionless the quantity in the parentheses: \\[\\left[\\frac{M}{1\\  kg}\\right] = 1\\] to render the quantity both dimensionless and unitless, \\(M\\) should be specified in kg. The usual practice is to skip the “1 kg” business and simply say, “Where \\(M\\) is in kg.” You will see such notation frequently in your career and should take care to use the indicated units.\nHere is an interactive R chunk for any calculations you need.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nConsider a baby and an adult.

Which of the following units for the constant of proportionality \\(k\\) is correct?\n\n\n cm\\(^2\\) kg\\(^{-2/3}\\)        cm\\(^2\\)        cm\\(^2\\) kg\\(^{2/3}\\)        kg\\(^{-1}\\)       \n\nquestion id: crow-mean-dress-2\n\n\n\nIn the units of part (B), which value is \\(k\\) closest to?\n\n\n 1        10        100        1000       \n\nquestion id: crow-mean-dress-3\n\n\nThe numerical value of the constant \\(k\\) changes depending on what units you want to express it in. The value you found in part (C) works for masses stated in kg and skin areas in cm\\(^2\\).\nSuppose you want to figure out a value of \\(k'\\) that you can use in the formula for people who are used to talking about skin area in square inches and mass in pounds. The units of \\(k\\) are cm\\(^2\\), and we want the units of \\(k'\\) to be in\\(^2\\). That part is easy: just multiply \\(k\\) by two flavors of one to change the units from cm to inches, like this:\n\\[k' = k\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\text{in}}{2.6 \\text{cm}}}_\\text{flavor of 1}\\  \\underbrace{\\frac{\\text{in}}{2.6 \\text{cm}}}_\\text{flavor of 1} = \\frac{k}{2.6^2}\\] where the flavor of 1 reflects that 1 inch is 2.6 cm.\nBut this is not the whole story. We have to be very careful in dealing with the \\(\\left(\\frac{M}{1 kg}\\right)^{2/3}\\). Translated to pounds, \\(M = 70\\ \\text{kg} = 154\\ \\text{lbs}\\), since, in the rough-and-ready way everyday people express themselves, 1 kg \\(\\approx\\) 2.2 lbs.  But people use it as if it were mass. A mass of 70 kg corresponds to about 4.8 slugs. In Earth’s gravity, the mass 4.8 slugs produces a force of 154 pounds.]To be precise, pounds is a measure of force, not mass. Mass in the traditional system has a unit name that few people recognize: slugs\nPlugging in \\(M=154\\) lbs makes the power-law part of the formula for skin area \\[\\left(\\frac{154\\ \\text{lbs}}{1\\ \\text{kg}}\\right)^{2/3}\\] You cannot take (pounds)\\(^{2/3}\\) or (kg)\\(^{2/3}\\); you won’t get a sensible unit in either case. But [pounds/kg] = [1], so taking the two-thirds power of the ratio is perfectly legitimate.\nStill, there is a problem. Multiplying \\(k\\ 154^{2/3} (\\text{lbs}/\\text{kg})^{2/3}\\) has the right dimension, but strange-looking units that have nothing to do with skin area.\nThe resolution to this paradox is to multiply \\(\\frac{154\\ \\text{lbs}}{1\\  \\text{kg}}\\) by an appropriate flavor of 1 to render the dimensionless quantity unitless as well as dimensionless. This flavor will be \\(\\frac{1 \\text{kg}}{2.2 lbs}\\), giving a formula for skin area in square inches:\n\\[S_{in}(M)= \\frac{k}{2.6^2}\\left(\\frac{154\\ \\cancel{\\text{lbs}}}{1\\ \\bcancel{\\text{kg}}}\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{1\\ \\bcancel{\\text{kg}}}{2.2\\ \\cancel{\\text{lbs}}}}_\\text{flavor of 1}\\right)^{2/3} = \\underbrace{\\frac{k}{2.6^2}\\ \\left(\\frac{1}{2.2}\\right)^{2/3}}_{k'\\ \\text{for inches and pounds}} 154^{2/3}\\]\n\nOptional challenge) Assuming that \\(k = 1000 \\text{cm}^2\\) when specifying mass in kilograms, what should be the numerical value of \\(k'\\) in square-inches that should be used when body mass is given in pounds?\n\n 8.7        87        870        8700        87000       \n\nquestion id: crow-mean-dress-5\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics.

In [Faulty cross reference: sec-magnitude-graphics] of the text you saw a graphical analysis that enables you to identify Boyle’s Law with a power-law relationship between pressure and volume: \\[P(V) = a V^n\\] On log-log axes, a power-law relationship shows up as a straight-line graphically.\nTaking logarithms translates the relationship to a straight-line function:\\[\\text{lnP(lnV)} = \\ln(a) + n\\,  \\ln(V)\\] To find the parameter \\(n\\), you can fit the model to the data.

When you carried out the log transformation, you used the so-called “natural logarithm” with expressions like log(pressure). Alternatively, you could have used the log base-10 or the log base-2, with expressions like log(pressure, base = 10) or log(volume, base = 2). Whichever you use, you should use the same base for all the logarithmic transformations when finding the straight-line parameters.\n\nDoes the slope of the straight line found by fitModel() depend on which base is used?\n\n\n No        Yes        There is no way to tell.       \n\nquestion id: dd-06-QA8\n\n\n\nDoes the intercept of the straight line found by fitModel() depend on which base is used?\n\n\n Yes        No       \n\nquestion id: dd-06-QA9\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10 Make the following log-log plot of horsepower (BHP) versus displacement (in cc, cubic-centimeters) of the internal combustion engines listed in the Engines data frame.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn the plot, you will see that the vertical axis has labels at 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000. These numbers are hardly spaced evenly when plotted on a linear scale, but on the log scale they are evenly spaced. Since there is a factor of ten between consecutive labels, the interval between the labels is called a decade. On the horizontal axis, the labels are at 10, 1000, 100,000, and 10,000,000. Each of those intervals spans a factor of one hundred. For instance, from 1000 is one-hundred times 10, 100,000 is one-hundred times 1000, and so on. An interval of size 100 is said to span two decades, not 20 years but a factor of 100.\nBased on the log-log plot, answer these questions.\n\nHow many engines have a displacement of 1 liter or less?\n\n\n none        7        14        25       \n\nquestion id: mag-blue-1\n\n\n\nUsing the log-log plot, how many decades of BHP are spanned by the data?\n\n\n 4        5        100       \n\nquestion id: mag-blue-2\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11 Figure 5 comes from an online guide, “Retirement Income Analysis with Scenario Matrices,” published in 2019 by William F.

The mortality rate is the probability of dying in one year. It is shown here as a function of age and sex.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the graph shows nearly parallel straight-line functions for both women and men, with women somewhat less likely than men to die at any given age.\n\nWhat is the format of the graphics axes?\n\n\n linear        semi-log        log-log       \n\nquestion id: olr19-1\n\n\n\nIf the age axis had a logarithmic axis, which of the following would be true?\n\n\n\n The interval from 50 to 55 would be graphically larger than the interval from 95 to 100.\n\n\n The interval from 50 to 55 would be graphically smaller than the interval from 95 to 100.\n\n\n The two intervals would have the same graphical length.\n\n\n\nquestion id: olr19-2\n\n\n\nAt age 100, which of these is closest to the mortality rate for men?\n\n\n About 10%        About 20%.        About 40%.        About 60%       \n\nquestion id: orl19-3\n\n\n\nAt age 65, women have a lower probability of dying than men.

This extrapolation would be statistically uncertain, and the pattern might change in the future either up or down, but let’s ignore that for now and simply extrapolate simply a line fitting the data from age 50 to 100.

Let’s explore this idea using actual data.\nThe COVID-19 Data Hub is a collaborative effort of universities, government agencies, and non-governmental organizaions (NGOs) to provide up-to-date information about the pandemic. We will use the data about the US at the whole-country level. (There is also data at state and county levels. Documentation is available via the link above.)\nPerhaps the simplest display is to show the number of cumulative cases (the confirmed variable) and deaths as a function of time. We will focus on the data up to June 30, 2020.\nRun the R/mosaic commands below to produce a graph of confirmed cases in blue and deaths in tan.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nAs of mid June, 2020 about how many confirmed cases were there? (Note that the labeled tick marks refer to the beginning of the month, so the point labeled Feb is February 1.)\n\n\n\n about 50,000\n\n\n about 200,000\n\n\n about 500,000\n\n\n about 1,000,000\n\n\n about 2,000,000\n\n\n about 5,000,000\n\n\n\nquestion id: maple-hit-saucer-1\n\n\nThis code makes the same graphic as above, but taking the logarithm (base 10) of the number of cases (that is, confirmed) and of the number of deaths. Since we are taking the logarithm of only the y-variable, this is called a “semi-log” plot.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUp through the beginning of March in the US, it is thought that most US cases were in people traveling into the US from hot spots such as China and Italy and the UK, as opposed to contagion between people within the US. (Such contagion is called “community spread.”) So let’s look at the data representing community spread, from the start of March onward.\nExponential growth appears as a straight-line on a semi-log plot. Obviously, the overall pattern of the curves is not a straight line. The explanation for this is that the exponential growth rate changes over time, perhaps due to public health measures (like business closures, mask mandates, etc.)\nThe first (official) US death from Covid-19 was recorded was recorded on Feb. 29, 2020. Five more deaths occurred two days later, bringing the cumulative number to 6.\n\nThe tan data points for Feb 29/March 1 show up at zero on the vertical scale for the semi-log plot. The tan data point for March 2 is at around 2 on the vertical scale. Is this consistent with the facts stated above?\n\n\n\n No. The data contradict the facts.\n\n\n Yes. The vertical scale is in log (base 10) units, so 0 corresponds to 1 death, since \\(\\log_{10} 1 = 0\\).\n\n\n No. The vertical scale does not mean anything.\n\n\n\nquestion id: maple-hit-saucer-2\n\n\nOne of the purposes of making a semi-log plot is to enable you to compare very large numbers with very small numbers on the same graph. For instance, in the semi-log plot, you can easily see when the first death occurred, a fact that is invisible in the plot of the raw counts (the first plot in this exercise).\nAnother feature of semi-log plots is that they preserve proportionality. Look at the linear plot of raw counts and note that the curve for the number of deaths is much shallower than the curve for the number of (confirmed) cases. Yet on the semi-log plot, the two curves are practically parallel.\nOn a semi-log plot, the arithmetic difference between the two curves tells you what the proportion is between those curves. The parallel curves mean that the proportion is practically constant. Calculate what the proportion between deaths and cases was in the month of May. Here’s a mathematical hint: \\(\\log_{10} \\frac{a}{b} == \\log_{10} a - \\log_{10} b\\). We are interested in \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nWhat is the proportion of deaths to cases during the month of May?\n\n\n about 1%        about 2%        about 5%        about 25%        about 75%       \n\nquestion id: maple-hit-saucer-3\n\n\nIn many applications, people use semi-log plots to see whether a pattern is exponential or to compare very small and very large numbers. Often, people find it easier if the vertical scale is written in the original units rather than the log units. To accomplish both, the vertical scale can be ruled with raw units spaced logarithmically, like this:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe labels on the vertical axis show the raw numbers, while the position shows the logarithm of those numbers.\nThe next question has to do with the meaning of the interval between grid lines on the vertical axis. Note that on the horizontal axis, the spacing between adjacent grid lines is half a month.\n\nWhat is the numerical spacing (in terms of raw counts) between adjacent grid lines on the vertical axis? (Note: Two numbers are different by a “factor of 10” when one number is 10 times the other.” Similarly, “a factor of 100” means that one number is 100 times the other.\n\n\n 10 cases        100 cases        A factor of 10.        A factor of 100.       \n\nquestion id: maple-hit-saucer-4\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 13 Figure 6 shows four frames from a movie showing (through a microscope) the growth of E. coli. bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n150 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n250 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\nIn each frame, count the number of bacteria.\nConstruct a data frame recording the time stamp and the number of bacteria in each frame.

Use linear, logarithmic or semi-logarithmic axes as most appropriate to show a simple pattern.\n\nA. Which type of axes shows the pattern most simply?\nB. Is the pattern most consistent with linear growth, exponential growth, or power-law growth.\nC. From your graph, find the parameter that describes the growth rate: - If linear growth, the slope of the line (give units) - If exponential growth, the doubling time (give units) - If power law, the exponent (which will not have units).\n\n14-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

The theory posits that the available maneuverability of an aircraft is closely related to its specific energy \\(E_s\\), that is, the kinetic plus potential energy of the aircraft divided by aircraft weight. To be highly maneuverable, an aircraft must be able to change it is specific energy rapidly in time. Let’s call this ability the specific power (that is, power divided by mass), \\(P_s\\). An aircraft with large \\(P_s\\) is more maneuverable than one with small \\(P_s\\).\nAn important formula in E-M Theory is \\[P_s = \\frac{T - D}{W} V\\] where \\(T\\) is aircraft thrust, \\(D\\) is drag, \\(W\\) is weight, and \\(V\\) is velocity. \\((T-D)\\). Thrust minus drag, is the net forward force on the aircraft.\nRecall these facts about the dimension of physical quantities:\n\nVelocity has dimension \\(L^1 T^{-1}\\) (e.g. meters per second)\nAcceleration has dimension \\(L^1 T^{-2} =\\) [Velocity] \\(\\times\\  T^{-1}\\) (e.g. meters per second-squared)\nForce has dimension \\(M \\times\\ \\) [Acceleration]\nEnergy has dimension [Force] \\(\\times\\  L\\)\nPower has dimension [Energy] \\(\\times\\  T^{-1}\\).\n\n\nWhich of the following is a correct dimensional formulation of power?\n\n\n\n [Force][Velocity]\n\n\n [Energy][Velocity]\n\n\n [Force] / [Velocity]\n\n\n [Energy] / [Velocity]\n\n\n\nquestion id: boyd-1\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the dimension of \\(P_s\\) in E-M Theory?\n\n\n\n [Power] \\(\\times\\ M^{-1}\\)\n\n\n [Force] \\(\\times\\) [Acceleration]\n\n\n [Force] \\(\\times\\) [Velocity]\n\n\n [Power]\n\n\n\nquestion id: boyd-2\n\n\n\n15-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Each goes to zero, leaving it to C to represent the ambient room temperature.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 Look at the fit of the sigmoidal function for peak oil. Show how it matches the yearly production data (a gaussian). Show models and residuals on semi-log axes.\n\n\nClass activity\n\nExercise 3  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Power produced by the author’s rooftop photovoltaic array in June 4 (solid line) and June 3 (bars), 2022.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 comes from the monitoring app for a photovoltaic (solar electricity) array on two consecutive days in June 2022. These data were presented first in ?exr-KINWgK, where you were asked to model the June 3 pattern as a bump function solar(t) multiplied by an irregular function cloudiness(t) with a domain between 0 (full cloudiness) and 1 (no clouds). The June 4 pattern is taken as the bump solar(t).\nWith that multiplicative model in mind, take a closer look at Figure 1, particularly for the early part of the day. In the interval from 6 to 9 am, the June 4 power production is below that of June 3.\n\nHow is this inconsistent with the “power(t) \\(\\equiv\\) solar(t) \\(\\times\\) cloudiness(t)” model?\nThe June 4 data starts low and then increases steeply around 9am. What evidence is there that the actual solar(t) function has a smoother increase? \nHaving in mind the modeling cycle, how might you modify the model simply to make it consistent with the data? (Hint: Is June 4 really a bump?) \n\nNote: At the end of the day, both the June 3 and June 4 data show an extra bump of a sort not seen in the pattern-book gaussian bump function. Potentially this could be due to cloudiness, but the amount of cloudiness would have to be exactly the same for June 3 and 4, which seem unlikely. More realistically, the bump represents an earlier fall off due to shadows of trees as the evening sun get low in the sky.\n\n\nExercise 4 Watch the movie in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of E. coli\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A movie showing growth of E. coli on a microscopic scale. Each rod is one bacterium.\n\n\n\nBacteria exhibit exponential growth under optimal conditions. In general, if the rate of growth depends on some quantity (here bacteria) then the exponential is the best first guess at a model. In the movie, notice that the rate of expansion depends on the number of bacteria present; the more E.coli, the faster the rate of growth. This is true for any exponential process: the instantaneous rate of growth or decay depends on the amount currently present.\nIf the experiment were continued indefinitely, the number of bacteria would eventually outgrow the petri dish or deplete their food source. When this happens, we say the bacteria have approached the carrying capacity of their environment. When the population is constrained in this way, a sigmoid would be a more appropriate model to start your modeling process. So, the deciding factor between exponential and sigmoid really depends upon whether 1) we assume a constrained or unconstrained environment, and 2) we let the bacteria reach the carrying capacity of the petri dish or not.\n\nIs there any obvious sign that the bacteria are reaching the carrying capacity of their environment before the end of the movie?\n\n\n\nEstimate the doubling time of the number of bacteria as they are growing exponentially. Do this by figuring out how long it takes the area of the colony to double (roughly). Hint: You’ll need to use the time marker in the bottom left corner of the movie.\n\n\n\nEstimate the doubling time in another way, by observing an individual bacterium. At any point in the movie, choose a bacterium at random. Watch it until it splits in two then, immediately, note the time. Watch some more until one of the two children split. The time difference between the mother’s split and the child’s split is the doubling time.\n\n\n\nCompare the doubling time for a mother in the center of a large colony to the doubling time of a mother on the edge of the colony. Is there any clear sign that growth in the more crowded part of the colony is slower than in the suburbs?\n\n\nCredit: Math 141Z/142Z 2021-2022 development team.\n\n\nExercise 5 A person breathes in and out roughly every three seconds. The volume \\(V\\) of air in the person’s lungs varies between a minimum of \\(2\\) liters and a maximum of \\(4\\) liters. Assume time \\(t\\) is measured in seconds.\nRemember that a full cycle of the sine wave \\(\\sin(x)\\) involves \\(x\\) going from its starting value to that value plus \\(2 \\pi\\).\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate of these models for \\(V(t)\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(V(t) \\equiv 2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{3} t \\right) + 2\\)\n\n\n \\(V(t) \\equiv \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} t \\right) + 3\\)\n\n\n \\(V(t) \\equiv 2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} t \\right)+ 2\\)\n\n\n \\(V(t) \\equiv  \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{3} t \\right) + 3\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: lamb-talk-gloves-QA1\n\n\nA respiratory cycle can be divided into two parts: inspiration and expiration. Please do an experiment. Using a clock or watch, breath with a total period of 3 seconds/breath, that is, complete one breath every three seconds. Once you have practiced this and can do it without forcing either phase of breathing, make a rough estimate of what fraction of the cycle is inspiration and what fraction is expiration. (The “correct/incorrect” answers here are right for most people. Your natural respiration might be different.)\n\nWhich is true?\n\n\n\n Inspiration lasts longer than expiration\n\n\n Expiration lasts longer than inspiration\n\n\n Inspiration and expiration each consume about the same fraction of the complete cycle.\n\n\n\nquestion id: lamb-talk-gloves-QA2\n\n\n\n\n\nMini modeling project\nThe data frame MMAC::SunsetLA records the number of minutes after 4 pm until the sun sets in Los Angeles, CA over a 4-year interval from January 2010 (month 1) through December 2013 (month 48).\n\nUse Active R chunk 1 to make a plot of sunset time versus month.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nWe are using both gf_point() and gf_line(). With data that oscillates up and down, connecting the data points with lines makes it easier to see the pattern. :::\n\nWhat is the range of the number of minutes until sunset over the whole 4-year period?\n\n\n 40 to 190 minutes        120 minutes        40 to 180 minutes        0 to 48 months       \n\nquestion id: sunset-in-LA-1\n\n\n\nThe data fall nicely on a sine-shaped curve. What is the period of that sine?\n\n\n\n 6 months\n\n\n 11 months\n\n\n 12 months\n\n\n 12 minutes\n\n\n\nquestion id: sunset-in-LA-2\n\n\nThe function \\[\\text{sunset}(\\text{Month}) \\equiv A  \\sin(2 \\pi\\, \\text{Month} / 12) + C\\] is a linear combination of two functions:\n\nThe constant function one(Month)\nThe sine function sin(2*pi*Month/12)\n\nThe two functions are scaled by \\(C\\) and \\(A\\), respectively.\nMake rough but reasonable numeric estimates for \\(C\\) and \\(A\\) from the data. Then, using Active R chunk 2, define the sunset() function using the numerical estimates in the linear combination. Plot your function as a layer on top of the data. (Pipe the gf_point() layer to slice_plot().)\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nThe domain for slice_plot() is inherited to that implied by the MMAC::SunsetLA data. Notice that the input name in slice_plot() corresponds to that established in gf_point().\nYour sunset() function should be a pretty good match to the data except for one thing. What is that thing?\n\n\n The sunset() function has a completely different range than the data.\n\n\n The period of the sunset() function does not match the data.\n\n\n There is a horizontal time shift between sunset() and the data.\n\n\n\nquestion id: sunset-in-LA-3\n\n\nWe will fix the problem with sunset() by defining a time offset to use as a reference. For a sine function, a suitable time offset is the value along the horizontal axis when the phenomenon being modeled crosses \\(C\\) with a positive slope. There are 4 such points along the horizontal axis readily identifiable in the data. (They may not be at an integer value of Month.)\n\nWhich of these is a suitable value for the time offset?\n\n\n\n 0 months\n\n\n 19 months\n\n\n 21.5 months\n\n\n 15.5 months\n\n\n\nquestion id: sunset-in-LA-4\n\n\nIn the original scaffolding, the value of offset was zero. Change that to match your answer to the previous question.\nPlot out the modified sunset() function and confirm that it is a much better match to the data than the original (that is, the one without the time offset). You can “tune” your function by tweaking the numerical values of the \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(offset\\) parameters until you get a solid match.\nAlternatively, you can use fitModel() to do the tuning for you. Plug in your estimates (a.k.a. “guesses”) for the parameters in place of the ___ in the following. Then run the code. You will see your estimate of the function compared to the result of having the computer refine your estimate. Chances are, the computer does a better job of stringing the function through the data.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 3\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nPerhaps you were expecting the tuned sine function to match the data exactly. It does not. One reason for this is that the Earth’s orbit around the Sun is not exactly circular. The sine function is only a model of the phenomenon, good for some purposes and not for others. For a more complete explanation, see this article on Wikipedia.\n(Thomas Swalm contributed to this project.)\n16-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

By July 2014, the outbreak spread to the capitals of all three countries.

    "text": "Data\nThe CDC data are provided to you as a dataframe named EbolaAll. The dataframe consists of 182 reports spread out over 18 months during 2014 and 2015. Each report is represented by a single row in the dataframe . Each report gives the number of new cases and disease-related deaths since the last report in each or three countries: Sierra Leon, Liberia, and Guinea. These values have been calculated from the raw, cumulative data. The data have been scrubbed to remove obvious errors.\n\n\nExploring the Data\nWe will begin by looking at some data. Use head(EbolaAll) to see the column headers and first 6 rows of data. As you can see, the EbolaAl dataframe is structured like a table, and each row contains multiple columns of data. The table below lists the column names found in EbolaAll dataframe along with a brief description of what the column records.\n\nDate: Date when the World Health Organization issued the report\nGcases: Number of new cases in Guinea\nGdeaths: Number of new deaths in Guinea\nLcases: Number of new cases in Liberia\nLdeaths: Number of new deaths in Liberia\nSLcases: Number of new cases in Sierra Leone\nSLdeaths: Number of new deaths in Sierra Leone\nTotCases: Total number of cases across all three countries\nTotDeaths: Total number of deaths across all three countries\n\nWe will focus on the Guinea data. As we have done throughout this book, we model this data using the pattern-book functions.\n\nUse Active R chunk 1 to plot the number of new cases in Guinea (variables Date and Gcases in dataframe EbolaAll).\n\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: Look at the shape of the graph. Of the functions we have studied, which would be most appropriate as a model for the new cases in Guinea? If none of the functions we have studied best matches this data, select “None of the above.”\n\nAlthough we are tempted to regard data sets as definitive, they are the culmination of an imperfect process of data collection in the field and imperfect processing/correction/amendment by people. For instance, most of the cases (and deaths) in the epidemic were never confirmed by viral testing and are considered “suspected cases.” Cases and deaths reported on one day might possibly be from previous days, and some cases and deaths were, no doubt, not reported.\nIn ?lst-ebola-2, run the following command to look at the data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe raw EbolaAll data\n\n\n\nThis table is interactive, to enable you to look around the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\nThe resulting display is interactive; you can page through the many rows of data.\n\nQuestion 2: Look through the data printout and find a data point form one of the World Health Organization reports that seems strange or inconsistent when compared with nearby reports. To receive full credit for this question, you must state the country and date of the report and explain your reasons for identifying this report as inconsistent.\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\nAn essential part of all projects involving data is to prepare the data for analysis: a process often called data wrangling. Although data wrangling is an important skill, it is not the topic of this book. So we will take care of the programming and present you with the results in the form of a data frame EbolaGuinea.\nThe wrangling accomplished two things: averaging the data over 7-report windows and extracting a numerical “day number” from the Date of each report.\nFirst, rather than working with the year:month:day format of Date, it is convenient to use a purely numerical quantity to represent time. So, we will translate the day when reports were issued into number of days from the initial report, presenting the result in the column Days. This makes the data-analysis programming easier, since all our mathematical software knows how to handle numbers, but not necessarily calendar dates.\nSecond, we will smooth the number of cases and the number of deaths. We did this by averaging each day’s number-of-cases and number-of deaths over several report. As you can see in the data, the interval between reports is not constant. Some reports occur just one day after the previous report; sometimes there is a week between reports. The widely spaced reports tend to have much higher cases and deaths than reports that come every day. This is for the simple reason that each report gives the number of new cases and deaths since the previous report; there is more time for the numbers to accumulate when there is a wide spacing between reports. The data reflect not just the process of the Ebola epidemic, but also the way the data were collected and reported, which is not directly of interest to us. To reduce this report-to-report fluctuation, we will average the number of new cases in each report with the three reports before and three reports after: a moving average over seven reports.\nThe result of our wrangling—the dataframe EbolaGuinea—includes three new columns:\n\nDays: When the report was issued in terms of a count of days from the initial report.\nG7Rcases: Number of new cases in Guinea averaged across 7 reports\nG7Rdeaths: Number of new deaths in Guinea averaged across 7 reports\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the outbreak\nIn Active R chunk 1, use gf_point() to plot the smoothed data in EbolaGuinea to show the time course of the epidemic. The variables you want to plot are G7Rcases versus Days. averaged number of new cases in Guinea (variables Days and G7Rcases in dataframe EbolaGuinea).\n\nQuestion 3 Look at the shape of the graph. Of the functions we have studied, which would be most appropriate as a model for the new cases in Guinea? If none of the functions we have studied best matches this data, select “None of the above.”\n\nIt is well known that the infection rate during an outbreak follows a Gaussian pattern when the population interacts consistently. Ebola initially spreads exponentially as people pass the virus to one another. As people are exposed to the virus, there are fewer and fewer people who are still susceptible. The result is that the rate of exponential growth slows and, when the fraction of the population that is susceptible becomes small, the epidemic slows down and the number of new cases decays exponentially. Overall, the pattern of new cases day-by-day looks like a gaussian: zero cases per day before the outputbreak, exponential growth at first after the virus is introduced to the population, leveling out for a time, and exponential decay back to zero new cases.\nThe graph of G7Rcases versus Days looks only vaguely like a gaussian bump. One possible explanation is that the data summarize more than one outbreak, as the virus spreads from one region to another. We will treat each individual output as a gaussian and try to figure out how many of them make up the whole data. The individual outbreaks will be modelled as a gaussian function with it is own center and width. The center for each gaussian corresponds to the peak of the hypothesized outbreak in one particular region.\nWe will combine the several gaussians in a linear combination. The scalar multiplying each gaussian is related to the size of the population exposed in each outbreak.\nHere is an R/mosaic definition of a linear combination of two gaussian outbreaks.\n\nmy_mod &lt;- makeFun(15800*(A*dnorm(t,m1,sd1) + \n                            (1-A)*dnorm(t,m2,sd2)) ~ t) \n\nThere are five parameters in the function. m1 the time when the first hypothesized outbreak peaked, m2 is the peak time of the second hypothesized outbreaks, and sd1 and sd2 reflect the duration of each outbreak. The parameter A represents the relative population sizes of the two regions. The number 15,800 reflects the total number of cases, which we know retrospectively. (The 15,800 includes a correction for the average day spacing between reports, but that detail need not concern us here.)\nNote that selecting A sets the amplitude for both Gaussians, i.e. A and 1−A. The amplitudes A and 1-A sum up to 1. Arranging things this way effectively make A the size of the one outbreak, leaving 1-A to be the size of the other outbreak.\nTo see how these Gaussians work together, start with the following values: A = 0.5, m1 = 150, sd1 = 50, m2 = 350, sd2 = 50. Do not change the 15800 number which reflects the overall size of the whole outbreak, as opposed to the relative size of the hypothesized individual outbreaks: A and 1-A.\nUse gf_point(), the pipe operator |&gt;, and slice_plot() to overlay your model on top of the data. Discrepancies between the model and the data can lead you to improve the model by adjusting the parameters. It is to be expected that you will need several cycles of such parameter adjustments until you find a model that seems to agree with the data in a satisfactory way. to you Guinea cases along with your model.\nOnce you have adjusted your model to match the data as closely as you can, write down the parameters you used in your report, as well as the graph comparing the data to your final model.\nQuestion 3: Find the longest time interval during which your model systematically overstates the number of cases. What’s the start and end of that interval? (Your answer can be rough, just so long as it points the reader of your report to the interval you mean.)\n\n\nMore data smoothing\nAccurately modeling the Guinea case data with two gaussian functions is difficult. Despite the smoothing, the numbers in G7Rcases fluctuate irregularly and substantially from report to report.\nAnother way to smooth the data, that is, to reduce the irregular report-to-report fluctuations, is to accumulate the number of new cases to get the total number of cases up through each report. (This accumulation, at the end of the epidemic, will be the total number of people who came down with Ebola illness.)\nSuch a sum of new cases from the beginning of the outbreak through the day of each report is called a cumulative sum or “running total.” Keep in mind that this is not a number, but a new column of data giving the number of cases to date for each of the dates in the data.\nTo illustrate, the small set of numbers: [1 2 3 4 5 6]. The cumulative sum of this set shows the running total: [1 3 6 10 15 21]. Make sure you are comfortable with how the second set of numbers is related to the first.\nThe R function cumsum() calculates the cumulative sum on a column of data. You will need to do a little data wrangling; we cannot do it for you because we don’t know what model you decided to settle on.\nThere are many computer systems for data wrangling. You may have heard of one called Structured Query Language (SQL) which is a required skill listed in many job listings and a multi-billion dollar component of the economy. We will use a system called dplyr specially designed for the R language. In the dplyr system, the function mutate() is used to create a new column in a data frame by carrying out calculations on the existing columns.\nHere is an R/dplyr command to generate the running total of cases. (we are using Gcases instead of the smoothed G7Rcases because the cumulative summing will do the smoothing for us.)\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nIt is worthwhile to parse that command carefully. The part to the right of &lt;- is an instruction for taking the EbolaGuinea data frame and adding a new column. The new column will be called GcasesTotal. The values in the new column will be generated by applying cumsum() to the Gcases column. Altogether, the right-hand side of the statement creates a new data frame that includes the new column. The left-hand side of the statement stores this new data frame under a name. For convenience, we are using EbolaGuinea as that name. Effectively, the command as a whole, including the name assignment EbolaGuinea &lt;- can be seen as updating the data frame with the new column.\nYou can verify that the new column is in place by showing the first several lines of the updated data frame:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUse gf_point() to plot GCasesTotal versus Days. The graph will show how the number of cases accumulated over time to to the overall total for the epidemic as a whole.\n\nQuestion 5: Consider which of the functions we have studied could be fitted to represent the GCasesTotal versus Days curve in your graph? it is likely that none of the functions we have studied fits the data particularly well, but one of them will be better than the others.\n\nWe haven’t forgotten that you already created a model of the new cases by a linear combination of gaussian functions. What we want to do now is translate your model for the number of new cases each day into a model of the cumulative number of cases to date. In other words, we want to perform the same action that cumsum() does, but applied to your model rather than data.\nTo do this, you will replace the gaussian dnorm() function in your model with the sigmoid pnorm(). No other changes are needed. This works because the gaussian and sigmoid functions are related to one another in just the same way as cumsum() relates the GCases column to the GCasesTotal column.\nRemember that the Gaussian and sigmoid functions are related to one another. The sigmoid is the accumulation of the Gaussian, i.e. It is the cumulative sum of the Gaussian. We will use this relationship to improve your double Gaussian model.\nCreate a new function in Active R chunk 1 called my_mod_cumulative(). Plot this new function over the GCasesTotal versus Dates data. As before, you can do this with gf_point(), the pipe operator |&gt;, and slice_plot().\n\nQuestion 6: Observe the rate of change (slope) of your model. The rate of change represents the number of new infections per day. Find the day on which your rate of change is greatest. Describe how this is related to the argmax of your model from Question 4.\n\nTry adjusting the parameters in my_mod_cumulative() to better match the function to the GCasesTotal data. Some aspects of the outbreak can be better seen from the cumulative number of cases to date, and other aspects may be better seen with the-newcases-each-day data.\nNow we will leverage the relationship between the Gaussian and sigmoid functions. Adjust your double Gaussian model and use the Question6 cumulative sums graph to evaluate your modifications. The procedure is outlined here:\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nThe gaussian as a model for the time course of new cases, and the sigmoid for the time course of accumulated cases to date, are well established. But here we’ve used two gaussians (or, equivalently, two sigmoids). So was there one outbreak or two?\n\nQuestion 7: Think about why the two-gaussian model matches the data better than the one-gaussian model. What might this mean in terms of the structure of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea? Don’t be afraid to speculate and frame your answer in terms that a layman might understand.\n\nThe modeling cycle is all about using your current model to identify ways that you might be able to improve the model. Of course, in practice, you need to present your model for use, so you have to exit the cycle at some point. You’re at that point now, but we ask you to reflect a bit more.\n\nQuestion 8: Given the results of your modeling efforts and your answer to Question 7, might it be better to model the outbreak using 3 or 4 Gaussians in our linear combination? What are the challenges associated with using more Gaussians?\n\n\nQuestion 9: The EbolaAll data frame records the Sierra Leone and Liberia outbreaks as well as the outbreak in Guinea. How might you use that additional data to explore the validity of your modeling process?\n\nAuthors: Prof. Robert Wolverson, USAFA & Daniel Kaplan, Macalester College and USAFA.",

    "text": "Project 2: Orbit dimensions\nThis activity will apply some of the concepts and techniques you’re learning to answer the following question:\n\nHow fast does a satellite move along its orbit?\n\nAs you can imagine, the answer is already known and you could look it up. The point of our reconstructing what is already known is to see the totality of a modeling project, even if it is a very simple one.\nIn textbooks and in-class demonstrations, students are often shown complete, flawless models. In reality, model construction is a matter of trial and error. Whoops! we are supposed to say “modeling cycle.” That phrase does not suggest anything about “error.” But in reality, modelers make mistakes, operate under misconceptions, collect erroneous data, misunderstand the purpose of building a model, and make all sorts of mistakes. To cope with this unhappy situation, good modelers are constantly checking and testing their models for inconsistencies.\nTo start, you should have\n\nA good idea of what the eventual answer will be. Often, that idea comes from somewhat vague and imprecise knowledge. For example, you may have heard that it takes a satellite in low orbit about 90 minutes to complete one circuit of the Earth. You may also know that the length of the equator is roughly 40,000 kilometers. (This is the original definition of the meter.) A velocity is distance traveled over time, so a satellite in low orbit has a velocity of roughly \\(40000 / 90\\) km/minute, which comes out to 7400 meters/second.\nA theory that relates what you want to know to what you already know. For our purposes, that theory comes directly from Isaac Newton in the 1680s: his laws of motion and his theory of universal gravitation.\n\n\nThe theory\nWe won’t assume that you have anything more than a vague understanding of Newton’s laws and theory of gravitation. The diagram shows the situation schematically.\n\nThe satellite is traveling clockwise along a curved trajectory encircling the Earth. The position of the satellite is shown at several times by the numbered blue dots. Let’s focus on the satellite at time 1.\nThe satellite is an object in motion. Newton’s First Law (“Lex I”) is stated in his 1687 book, Philosophiae Naturis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical principles of natural philosophy) on p.12\n\nTranslating into English, this is\n\nLaw I: Every body persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled to change that motion by forces impressed upon it.\n\nThe dashed line connecting the points labeled 1 and 2’ shows the path that the satellite would follow if there were no forces impressed upon it.\nYet there is a force impressed on the satellite: the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the satellite. This force accelerates the satellite perpendicular to its orbit (toward the center of the Earth) causing the satellite to follow a curved path rather than a straight path off into deep space. The acceleration of the satellite traveling at constant speed in orbit depends on both the velocity \\(v\\) of the satellite and the radius \\(r\\) of its orbit.\nTask #1: Let \\(A_1\\) be the acceleration needed to keep the satellite in a circular orbit. Find a plausible relationship between \\(A_1\\), \\(r\\), and \\(v\\). One possibility is that the relationship is a general product of the form \\[A_1 = v^n\\ r^m .\\] Use dimensional analysis to find \\(n\\) and \\(m\\). Recall that acceleration has dimension L/T\\(^{2}\\), velocity has dimension \\(L/T\\) and radius has dimension L.\nOnce you determine \\(n\\) and \\(m\\), write down the relationship \\(A_1\\) as a function of \\(r\\) and \\(v\\).\n\nAs we all know, gravity pulls all objects toward the center of the Earth. The acceleration \\(A_2\\) due to gravity on an object a distance \\(r\\) from the enter of the Earth is proportional to the mass of the Earth and is known to be \\[A_2  = G\\ M_e/r^2\\] where \\(G\\) is a constant of proportionality and \\(M_e\\) is the mass of Earth.\nIn order for the satellite to stay in orbit, the two accelerations \\(A_1\\) (what’s needed to stay in orbit) and \\(A_2\\) (what the Earth’s gravity provides) must be equal.\nTask #2: Set your expression for \\(A_1\\) equal to the expression for \\(A_2\\) and solve for the velocity \\(v\\) of the satellite (our original objective for this exercise). Your answer will involve \\(G\\), \\(M_e\\), and \\(r\\).\nUse the known numerical values for \\(G\\) and \\(M_e\\) given in the next section to check that your answer makes sense.\n\n\nThe data\nThe data here come from scientific observations made over centuries that give us numerical values (with units) of \\(M_e\\) and \\(G\\) in the theory.\n\\(G\\) is a universal constant (according to Newton’s theory of gravitation). The quantity is given by several sources as\n\\[G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} m^3 /(s^2 kg).\\]\nSimilarly, the mass of the Earth is given as\n\\[M_e  = 5.972 × 10^{24} kg\\]\nThese reported facts seem plausible, but it is a good practice to check. Toward that end, check\n\nThe dimension and units of \\(A_2(v, r)\\) are consistent.\nThe value of \\(A_2\\) at the Earth’s surface is consistent with the famous value 9.8 m/s\\(^2\\).\n\nTask #3: Finishing up.\nUse the formula you derived for \\(v\\) as a function of \\(r\\), \\(G\\), and \\(M_e\\) to find \\(v\\) for a satellite in low orbit around the Earth. The official extent of the “Low Earth Orbit Region” is up to 2000 km. If you were using the altitude of the International Space Station (400 km), you would set \\(r = r_e + 400km\\), where \\(r_e\\) is the radius of the earth: 6, 378.1 km.\nAs always, you want to do the calculation in a way that helps you to spot possible errors. Here are two good practices:\n\nYou have already confirmed (or should have) that your formula for \\(v\\) as a function of \\(r\\), \\(G\\), and \\(M_e\\) is dimensionally consistent. As you plug in numerical values for \\(r\\), \\(G\\), and \\(M_e\\), make sure to keep track of the units explicitly and that the result you get has proper units for velocity.\nCompare your result to the rough estimate of \\(v\\) for satellites in low orbit that you made at the beginning of this activity. If there is a discrepancy, review both your initial rough estimate as well as your gravity-based derivation of \\(v\\) to figure out where the inconsistency comes from. Then fix it.",

    "text": "Engine scaling\n\nLeast squares and engines\nIn this Project, we’re going use ideas about dimensions and power-law functions and the tools of linear combinations to uncover some basic physical power-law principles about internal combustion engines from data on a wide array of engine sizes.\nThe data frame Engines (in the Zcalc package) records the characteristics of 39 different internal combustion engines ranging in weight from 2 ounces to 100,000 pounds and for applications ranging from model airplanes to massive ships.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nInternal combustion engines\nAs often in case in modeling projects, it’s important to know something about the systems you are modeling. You might want to follow these links to learn the basic mechanics and functionality of internal combustion engines.\n\nTwo-stroke engine cycle animation\nFour-stroke engine cycle animation\nEngine displacement\n\nMake sure you are comfortable with at least the following aspects of internal combustion engines:\n\nPower is generated by burning a fuel (such as gasoline) in one or more cavities called “cylinders.”\nAs the fuel is burned, the increase in pressure due to heating inside the cylinder causes a “piston” to be pushed out of the engine.\nThe straight-line motion of the piston is converted to rotary motion. The rotary motion conveys the power the engine delivers. It also causes the piston to move back into the cylinder compressing the residual gas in the cylinder. What happens next depends on whether the engine is designed as a two-stroke or four-stroke, but in either case, the piston/cylinder combination eventually reaches a state of compressed air and fuel, ready to be burned for the next push of the piston.\nEach two- or four-stroke cycle converts chemical energy into the kinetic energy of a moving piston. Recall the distinction between “energy” and “power.” Power is a rate: the amount of energy per unit time.\nThe mechanical power generated by an engine depends on many factors, for instance the amount of fuel burned each cycle, the number of cylinders, the time period of each cycle.\nEngineers make choices about the design of an engineering with the goals of 1) generating the mechanical power required, 2) efficiency in fuel use, 3) adequate strength to resist the forces generated in the engine cycle such as the peak pressure in a cylinder, 4) durability, and so on. Engines designed for different purposes are not generally just a scaled up version of a standard engine; the proportions within the engine differ.\n\nTo give an example, consider the cycle duration of each engine. This is given in RPM, short for “revolutions per minute” which you can convert to the duration of each revolution. The graph below shows the mechanical power output (BHP – short for “brake horsepower”) versus engine RPM. You can see a general pattern that engines with very large BPH revolve slowly. For instance, the two largest-power engines (about 30,000 BHP, equivalent to 22 megawatts) rotate at about 120 revolutions per minute, corresponding to an up-down cycle for a piston of one-half second. The smallest engines rotate roughly 100 times faster. (This high rate accounts for the high-pitched whine associated with tiny engines as compared to the low-pitched rumble of massive engines.)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSuppose the engineer starts her design with a proposed RPM for the engine to deliver the power needed. Knowing RPM and power, the engineer can determine how much fuel needs to be burned in each cycle. Knowing the thermodynamics of fuel burn, the engineer can choose an appropriate configuration of the number of cylinders, the stroke volume of each cylinder, and the diameter (“bore”) of each cylinder. These, in turn, determine the force on the piston and cylinder and hence the material and mass of the engine. For model-airplane applications, the engineer will prioritize the power-to-mass ratio, perhaps sacrificing longevity. For ship applications, the power-to-mass ratio is not so important (ships are good at carrying very heavy things), but longevity is essential (replacing an engine weighing 50 tons from the deepest recesses of the ship is prohibitively expensive).\nConsequently, all of these factors–mass, RPM, bore, stroke, etc.–are related to one another in perhaps intricate and unexpected ways. Your task is to discover some of these relationships from the data and, as well as you can, describe and explain them.\nSome tools and concepts at your disposal:\n\nPhysical relationships such as size, volume, and speed are often in the form of a power-law, so you will want to find power-law relationships.\nAs you remember, a power-law relationship shows up as a straight line on log-log axes.\nYou can find the slope of the straight-line relationship by fitting the logarithms of the variables to a linear model, e.g. \\(\\ln(y) \\equiv a \\ln(x) + b\\). This corresponds to the power law relationship \\(y = \\alpha x^a\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant of proportionality reflecting the units involved.\nWhen more than one input variable is involved, power-law relationships look like \\(y = \\alpha  x^a z^b w^c\\). Taking logs of both sides produces a generalization of the straight-line model to higher dimensions, namely \\(\\ln(y) \\equiv a \\ln(x) + b \\ln(z) +  c \\ln{w}  + d\\),\nYou can use techniques of linear combinations to determine the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and the other parameters. This requires software to solve the target problem which will be framed like this:\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might expect engine power to be proportional to the number of cylinders (which would give an exponent on ncylinder of 1.0), but evidently design constraints lead engineers to put proportionately more cylinders on big engines.\nYou can also see that the exponent on strokes is -1. If you know about engines, you’ll know that a two-stroke engine generates power every cycle, but a four-stroke engine generates power only every second cycle. Thus, at a given RPM and other design features, a four-stroke engine would generate half the power of a two-stroke engine. In other words, engine power is proportional to strokes\\(^{-1}\\).\nYou can also see that the \\(R^2\\) statistic indicates that the three variables RPM, ncylinder and strokes account for the vast majority of the engine-to-engine variation in BHP.\nThe above three paragraphs are the style of narrative explanation you should give for your explanation of the relationships you find. Do the best you can relating the power-law exponents to the mechanics of engine operation, although we hardly expect you to come up on your own with a relationship like BHP proportional to strokes\\(^{-1}\\). Give any reasonable speculation you want in describing the “why” of the relationships you find. We are looking for speculation that’s justified by the data. Since this isn’t a course about internal combustion engines, we’re looking more for creativity than matching the actual functioning of engines.\nEssay 1: Explain briefly in your your own words why it’s appropriate to use logarithms and linear combinations in finding a power-law model such as \\(\\gamma  x^a z^b w^c\\) which doesn’t involve addition.\n\nNote on proportionality. A function such as \\(f(x) \\equiv 3 x\\) has a property called “proportionality.” Proportionality means that doubling the input produces a doubled output. (Try it by applying the function to an input \\(x = 1\\), producing \\(f(x)=3\\). Then double \\(x\\) and see what happens to \\(f(x)\\).) Many people are surprised at first to realize that a function like \\(g(x) = 3 x + 2\\) is not proportional. (Try the plug-in experiment.) Yet the relationship \\(h(x, y) = 3 x  y\\) is proportional in each of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nTry the plug-in experiment with \\(h(x, y) = 3 x y\\). Start by assigning numerical values to both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and calculating the resulting \\(h(x, y)\\).\n\nTrue or false: For function \\(h(x, y)\\) doubling input \\(x\\) leads to doubling \\(h(x, y)\\).\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: engine-scaling-1\n\n\n\nTrue or false: For function \\(h(x, y)\\) doubling input \\(y\\) leads to doubling \\(h(x, y)\\).\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: engine-scaling-2\n\n\n\nTrue or false: For function \\(h(x, y)\\) doubling input \\(x\\) and simultaneously doubling input \\(y\\) leads to doubling \\(h(x, y)\\).\n\n\n\n TRUE\n\n\n FALSE\n\n\n\nquestion id: engine-scaling-3\n\n\n\n\nStarting out\nAs a matter of geometry, engine displacement is proportional to the number of cylinders (ncylinder) times the stroke length (stroke not strokes) times the square of the cylinder diameter (bore). That is, in any given engine, displacement is \\(\\alpha\\) ncylinder\\(^1 \\times\\) stroke\\(^{1} \\times\\) bore\\(^2\\). Determine whether the engine data is consistent with this. (Note: Expect only rough correspondence between a stated theory and the data. Remember that the engine design always involves choices. For instance, over the wide range of engines represented in the data, designers might have made choices like “long strokes” should be paired with smaller bores.)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nEssay 2: Explain what about your model is consistent or not with the geometry theory of displacement. If you see other patterns in the coefficients, describe them and speculate why they might show up.\n\nEssay 3: Explain why it’s appropriate for the tilde expression used in lm() to involve so many calls to the log() function. If the reason is obvious to you, don’t feel you need to chase down subtle answers; just say the obvious.\n\n\n\nAnother example\nThe force on a piston will be proportional to the surface area of the piston (related to bore) and the square of the RPM times the stroke length (all other things held constant). To keep engine parts from breaking from the force, they must be stoutly designed. One way to accomplish this is to increase the engine mass. This proposed relationship between mass, bore, RPM, and stroke is merely a theory. It might be that it applies only to particular parts in the engine and not to the entire engine mass.\nUse the data to determine whether the simple theory (the theory about the relationship between engine mass, bore, RPM, and stroke) holds up in practice. In your essay, describe what about the model leads you to conclude that the theory holds or not.\nEssay 4: Explain what about your model is or is not consistent or with the simple theory of mass/strength/RPM. If you see other interesting patterns in the coefficients, describe them and speculate why they might show up.\n\n\n\nCylinder shape\nConsider the shape of a cylinder. As you know, the caps of a cylinder are circles; the volume of a cylinder is the area of the circular cap times the height of the cylinder. Of course, there are many different shapes of cylinders that have the same volume: small caps and tall height or large caps and short. One way to describe the shape of a cylinder of a given volume is by the ratio of the height to the diameter the circular cap. The height of each engine’s cylinder is given as its stroke length. The diameter of the circular cap is the bore. If all engines had the same shape cylinder, the ratio of stroke to bore would be constant. In reality, stroke/bore ratio varies by a factor of 3 from one engine to another.\nIt’s reasonable to expect that the engine designers made their choices of cylinder shape based on the use of the engines or other features of the engine design. Your job is to build a model of cylinder shape as a function of other variables describing the engine.\nThe sandbox below has a command that creates a variable c_ratio whose value is the stroke/bore ratio. (Don’t worry about understanding the command. You just have to know that it creates the new variable c_ratio by dividing stroke by bore.) When you build your model, put log(c_ratio) on the left side of the tilde expression and the logs of other engine variables on the right, just as you did in the previous two examples.\nSee what you can find and describe your findings in the essay box.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nEssay 5: What (if anything) accounts for the variation in cylinder shape?",

    "text": "Making the grade\nIn this project we’ll model energy consumption for walking uphill for a distance \\(d\\) at grade \\(g\\). The goal of this project is to determine whether there is an optimal grade that minimizes energy consumption per altitude gained. You’ll translate your results into a recommendation to the National Park Service for designing challenging (but not too challenging!) hiking paths through a hilly terrain to reach a scenic viewpoint at the top of a hill or the crest of a ridge. Finally, you’ll illustrate your findings by drawing an example of a suitable route for a path.\nIt’s important to agree on some terminology. Figure 1 shows a simple mathematical model of a hillside. The coordinate system is \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) marking position on the horizontal plane and \\(z\\) denoting the altitude of the hillside at any \\(x\\), \\(y\\) point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The geometry of a model hillside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A simple terrain near the top of a hill. The red vectors show the gradient of the function at the point marked by the root of the vector. These gradient vectors correspond to \\(y\\) in Figure 1. The \\(x\\) vector is perpendicular to each gradient.\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, Figure 1 does not look much like a real hillside, but keep in mind that this is calculus. Figure 1 is a good representation of a very small bit of hillside. The \\(y\\) axis in Figure 1 points directly uphill. To translate this to a bigger picture, focus on the gradient vector in ?fig-simple-domain located at (104.57 W, 38.43 N). We would align the \\(y\\) vector in Figure 1 with the gradient vector in Figure 2. The \\(x\\) vector in Figure 1 will translate into a vector that’s perpendicular to the gradient vector. As a result the blue plane in Figure 1 corresponds to the small blue patch in Figure 2.\nRefer back to Figure 1. The grade of the inclined plane, going in the steepest direction, is \\(c/b\\), where \\(c\\) is the height of the top of the inclined plane, and \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the top. A person desiring to find a shallower grade can walk obliquely, as in path \\(d\\). The red dashed line shows the route of this path on the \\(x,y\\)-plane, the the person is also ascending as they go up the path. So, starting with coordinate \\((x=0, y=0, z=0)\\), the person walking up path d will end up at coordinate \\((x=a, y=b, z=c)\\). Thus, the length of path d will be \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\\).\nThe grade of path d is the vertical distance divided by the horizontal distance (that is, the distance in the \\(x,y\\)-plane). This distance is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), so the grade of path d is \\(g_{path} = c / \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).",

For instance …\n\nThe ACSM values of \\(h=0.1\\) and \\(v=1.8\\) are estimates. Presumably there is some variation from one person to another as well as uncertainty in the estimate itself.\nThe minimum might be sharp or broad. This is a question of how much changing the input value changes the output value.\n\nHow to take these matters into account when giving your recommendation for an optimal grade? Here are some ideas.\nThe ACSM is the American College of Sports Medicine. Presumably the people they studied are athletes, not necessarily typical visitors to a national part.\n\nDo you think a typical park visitor would have larger or smaller \\(v\\) than an athlete? It’s reasonable to think that \\(v\\) might be different by a factor of 3 in non-athletes. How does such a change in \\(v\\) change the argmin grade and the min of the energy?\n\n\nIt may not be important to operate exactly at the argmin. What’s important is that the energy expended not be crazy bad.\n\nOne way to think about how acceptable is a grade is to think about how sensitive the output of the energy function is to a change in grade. Pick some percentage change that you regard as hardly likely to be noticed by a park visitor. (Give some justification for your selected percentage, but of course there is no exact right choice.) Translate your percentage into a range of distances \\(d\\) that is consistent with a change in output less than your percentage. Then convert the range in \\(d\\) to a range in \\(g\\).",

Must the grade be exactly that? Try to avoid such narrow communication.\nYou report a range of acceptable grades. This way if the path designer runs into some problem with a particular path, he or she can consider reasonable alternatives.\nYou report (2), but you also translate that into terms that will be comfortable for a decision-maker who is not mathematically trained. (You might be surprised how many well-educated people do not assimilate percentages well.)\n\nOne way to help people visualize your recommended grade … Pick a few real-world examples of paths, both steep and shallow. For example, there’s the Manitou incline near Colorado Springs as an example of a steep hike. Heartbreak Hill in the Boston Marathon has earned it’s name. Another example, pick a couple of streets in San Francisco, perhaps one with a cable-car running along it.\n\nReport your results in the form of a table showing your recommendations alongside the real-world examples.\n\n\nDraw some example paths on a real terrain. To support you in this task, here is a contour map of some imagined parkland. The contours are spaced 10 meters apart vertically and the axes give (horizontal) distance in meters.\n\nTranslate the upper and lower bounds of your grade interval (as in (2)) into a number of meters you must walk horizontally to go from one contour to the next. For instance, suppose your grade interval translate into 50 meters to 75 meters horizontally. (But use your own grade interval.)\nMark off on a ruler the horizontal distance that must be covered in going from one contour to another. (The red vertical bar in the top left is 50 meters long, the blue is 30 meters.) Then, from the starting point of the path, use that horizontal distance to connect to the next highest contour. Continue on from there, one contour at a time. If you find that the horizontal distance isn’t sufficient to reach the next contour, then your grade will be shallower than the most efficient one. So be it.\nAfter printing out this imagined map use the method in the previous paragraph to draw a path connecting the starting point for the path to the scenic outlook at the top of the hill at a grade that is as close as you can get to the bottom bound on efficient grade that you found. Then draw another path at the top bound for efficient grade.

But the function is exponential, so not a straight line.\nA fundamental idea in calculus is that even a function with a curved graph will look like a straight line if you zoom in closely around a given point. And you know how to calculate the slope of a straight line.\nWhen the graph is curved, the slope will be different at different points along the graph. So there is not a single slope for the function. Still, we can talk about the “slope at a point.”\nOne way to specify a point on a function’s graph is to give the horizontal coordinate: the input to the function. But here we will give you the output of the function. So long as the function passes the horizontal-line test, as the exponential does, specifying any particular output in the function’s range uniquely identifies a corresponding input.\nEstimate the slope of the exponential function \\(g(x) \\equiv e^x\\) at several inputs, which we will call \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\).

That change is sometimes called the rise in the value of the function. Rise always compares (by subtraction) the two output values corresponding to two specific input values. Remember that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) stand for specific numbers.\nCorresponding with the idea of the change in output being \\(f(b) - f(a)\\) the change in the input value to a function is \\(b - a\\). This is often called the run in the value of the input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue or false: In Graph I, the rise from a to b is positive.\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: snail-tear-blanket-1\n\n\n\nTrue or false: In Graph I, the run from \\(x=a\\) to \\(x=b\\) is positive.\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: snail-tear-blanket-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue or false: In Graph II, the run from a to b is positive.\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: snail-tear-blanket-3\n\n\n\nTrue or false: In Graph II, the rise from a to b is positive.\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: snail-tear-blanket-4\n\n\n\nTrue or false: In Graph II, the run from b to c is positive.\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: snail-tear-blanket-5\n\n\n\nTrue or false: In Graph II, the rise from b to c is positive.\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: snail-tear-blanket-6\n\n\n\nFor an interval [2, 6] what is the value of the run?

It’s tempting to translate this as “make \\(h\\) as small as possible,” but the mathematical meaning doesn’t involve the concept of “as possible.” Smaller—but not zero!—is better. However, in numerical calculations, such as those done by numD(), a sufficiently small \\(h\\) makes the calculation unreliable. That is, you can easily go too far and set \\(h\\) too small in the slope function. The problems this causes will become obvious in the graph when \\(h\\) is too small.\nActive R chunk 1 calculates and plots a numerical derivative of the sinusoid function, using a specified value of \\(h\\). (That’s the argument named .h.) Remake the plot, using every smaller .h, until you start to see imperfections in the calculated values.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nWhich of these values for h is the smallest you can go before the problems of too-small h start showing up?\n\n\n h=0.00001\n\n\n h=0.00000001\n\n\n h=0.000000000001\n\n\n h=0.00000000000001\n\n\n h=0.000000000000000001\n\n\n\nquestion id: h-too-small-1\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1, which of the line segments is tangent to the curve at the point marked with a dot?\n\n A        B        C        all of them        none of them       \n\nquestion id: reptile-put-kitchen-1\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3 Sometimes a bit of algebra can help us see what’s going on with the instantaneous rate of change. Consider the exponential function \\(e^x\\).\nRather than writing the slope function definition with a 0.1, let’s substitute in the symbol \\(h\\). This gives \\[{\\cal D}\\exp(x) = \\frac{e^{x+h} - e^x}{h}\\] Extracting out the common term \\(e^x\\) in the numerator, we arrive at \\[{\\cal D}\\, e^x = \\frac{e^x e^h - e^x}{h} = e^x \\left[\\frac{e^h - 1}{h}\\right] \\tag{1}\\]\nMath expression 1 shows that the slope function of \\(e^x\\) is proportional to \\(e^x\\) itself. The constant of proportionality is \\([e^h - 1]/h\\).\n\nIs \\([e^h - 1]/h\\) a function of \\(x\\)?\n\n\n Yes        No       \n\nquestion id: lamb-put-bulb-1\n\n\nKeep in mind that our interest is in \\({\\cal D}\\, e^x\\). The role of \\(h\\) is analogous to scaffolding on a building site. We seek to remove it eventually. Ideally, if we make \\(h\\) small enough, it will vanish.\n\nUsing Active R chunk 2, find the value of \\([e^h - 1]/h\\) when \\(h=0.1\\).

You will have to make equal monthly payments \\(P\\) for five years (60 months) to pay off the loan. At an interest rate of \\(r\\) per month, your payment will be: \\[P(L, r) = L r \\frac{(1+r)^{60}}{(1+r)^{60} - 1}\\]\nFor example, if the interest rate is 0.005 per month (roughly 6% = 0.06 per year), your monthly payment would be\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 7\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nYou are a good negotiator and are trying to talk the car dealer down to a zero-percent loan. The dealer plugs \\(r=0\\) into the car-loan calculator. His response to you: “Sorry, but our system cannot handle zero-percent loans.”\n\nExplain what about the output of the calculator supports the dealer’s response. (Use Active R chunk 7 to simulate the dealer’s calculator.)\n\n\n\nLook at the formula in Active R chunk 7. At some point, for \\(r=0\\), the calculation divides by zero and multiplies by zero. Explain what about the formula causes this to happen.\n\n\nYou press the point. “Excuse me, Sir, but I’m reading MOSAIC Calculus. That NaN appearing on your screen is the result of a division by zero in the formula. But there is no reason to do that division. At zero percent interest, the monthly payment will simply be the amount borrowed divided by the number of months of the loan, so $10,000 divided by 60, giving a monthly payment of $166.6666… .”\n“I’m sure you’re very good at math,” the dealer says, “and I’m willing to agree to a monthly payment of $166.67, but I cannot process any loan without going through this computer system. And zero percent won’t fly.”\nHaving studied limits, you have an idea. “Suppose we agree on a non-zero interest rate—which your loan system can handle—that produces a monthly payment of $166.67? Can we write up the loan that way?”\nDealer: “I’d be happy to do that, but obviously it is impossible to find an interest rate greater than zero that gives the same result as your calculation for zero interest.”\nYou: “Let’s try. Instead of 0.005 for the monthly interest rate, put in \\(r = 0.0005\\). You’re computer can work with that, right?”\nDealer: “OK, let’s see. … Yes, the payment amount is $169.22. That’ll work.”\nYou: “We are making progress. But my sense of mathematical honor insists that we find an interest rate that gives $166.67, as close as we can practically get to the exact answer result $166.6666… .”\n\nWork through the sequence \\(r = 0.005\\), \\(r = 0.0005\\), \\(r  = 0.00005\\), making \\(r\\) smaller and smaller. Is there a small but non-zero \\(r\\) that brings the payment to the agreed-upon goal of $166.67?. Explain what about the output of the calculator supports the dealer’s response. If so, what’s the largest \\(r\\) that will bring you there.\n\n\n 5e-04        5e-05        5e-06        0.0000005        5e-08        5e-09        5e-10        no such \\(r\\)       \n\nquestion id: low-low-rates-3\n\n\nLater in the day, you tell the story to your roommate, who is a computer science major. She says that you were lucky. “Computer arithmetic isn’t the same as mathematical arithmetic. Computer calculations with very small numbers sometimes give different results than you would expect mathematically. I bet if you tried an even smaller \\(r\\), you would have gotten different answers or even just nonsense.”\n\nWork through smaller and smaller \\(r\\) in the car-loan calculator. What happens as you continue the sequence from the previous question, adding in more zeros before the 5?\n\n\n\n The result steadily gets closer to 166.6666….\n\n\n At first, the result gets closer to 166.6666, but then as \\(r\\) gets smaller the result stays the same.\n\n\n The result falls below 166.666 and stays there.\n\n\n The computer output shows a result of infinity.\n\n\n\nquestion id: low-low-rates-4\n\n\nSee this news story from 1991 for a real-world example of a similar flaw.\n\n\nExercise 6 Use Active R chunk 8 for evaluating \\(\\sin(x)/x\\) at tiny values of \\(x\\) or for plotting it on a domain that is somewhat wider. To answer the questions, you just have to change tinyx.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 8\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Active R chunk 8, add more zeros to tinyx to make it even smaller. You can stop when you get tired. Does \\(\\sin(x)/x\\) evaluate to something sensible for such tiny input values? If so, what value?\n\n\n 0        1/2        1        answer varies with \\(x\\) as \\(x\\) gets smaller       \n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-toss-gloves-1\n\n\nSaying, “so small that I got tired typing the zeros” is not a convincing definition of “small” to a mathematician. For example, 0.0000000000000001 parsec (a unit of length) seems small but it is equivalent to about 10 feet—not so small. Mathematicians want you to take “small” to the limit, an arbitrarily large number of zeros, and when you’re done with that, even more zeros.\nFortunately, R and other computer languages have a scientific notation that allows you just to name the number of zeros you want after the decimal point. For instance 1e-2 is \\(0.01\\)—one zero. Similarly 1e-20 is \\(0.00000000000000000001\\), nineteen zeros.\n\nAgain use Active R chunk 8, but this with scientific notation so that you can look at \\(x\\) as small as 1e-31 (30 zeros) or even smaller. Starting at x = 1e-31, calculate sin(x)/x. Then double the number of zeros, keep on doubling the number of zeros. The result will continue to be 1 … until it eventually becomes NaN. How many zeros are there in the x that produces NaN as the answer to sin(x)/x?\n\n\n 127        191        323        379        1281       \n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-toss-gloves-2\n\n\nWhat’s happening here has more to do with the nature of computers than the nature of numbers. Computers (in the manner they are ordinarily programmed) use packets of bits to represent numbers, and the chips have been engineered to make those bit packets respond to arithmetic operations as if they were the numbers they represent. A typical computer number, like 0.001, uses 64 bits in a special, standard format. Since there is a finite number of bits, there is a largest possible non-Inf number and a smallest possible non-zero number. According to the IEEE standard for “floating-point” arithmetic the largest non-Inf number is around 1e300 and the smallest non-zero number is around 1e-320. This failure to behave like genuine mathematical numbers is called “overflow” (for large numbers which turn into Inf) and “underflow” (for small numbers which turn into 0).\n\nPlay around with numbers in the format 1e300, 1e301 and so on until you find the smallest 1e??? that prints as Inf. Similarly, try numbers in the format 1e-320 and 1e-321 until you find the largest one that prints out as exactly zero. What are those two numbers?\n\n\n\n 1e305 and 1e-322\n\n\n 1e306 and 1e-323\n\n\n 1e308 and 1e-324\n\n\n 1e309 and 1e-327\n\n\n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-toss-gloves-3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7 It is simple enough to say to an elementary-school pupil that “division by zero is an error.” But what is a computer to do when, for whatever reason, it divides by an amount that is zero generated by a not-erroneous earlier computation? In many computer languages (including R) the programmer can arrange that a unacceptable situation causes an error message to be “thrown.” This generally causes the program to stop. See this account of the USS Yorktown (under “Smart ship testbed”) for an example of why stopping the program is not always an acceptable practice.\nModern computer arithmetic systems, implemented in hardware, take a different approach to division by zero. Rather than an error, divide-by-zero calculations return a definite value called “not a number” and printed as NaN. Rather than stopping the program, calculations can continue on. Any calculation involving NaN, such as 3 + NaN or NaN/NaN produces a NaN. This clever design allows the system-level programmer to determine where and whether a division by zero needs to be dealt with.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 9\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nWarm up: Using the sandbox, determine which one of these arithmetic expressions does not produce NaN as the output.\n\n\n 1/0        0/0        0*NaN        NaN/NaN        5e20 + NaN*1e-50        NaN - NaN        NaN * Inf        sin(NaN)        sqrt(NaN)        Inf/Inf        1/Inf       \n\nquestion id: NaN-numerics-0\n\n\nThe NaN strategy is effective in plotting. Programs such as slice_plot() simply ignore points whose value is NaN. As a result, the shape of the graph is determined by those points nearby, not at, the singularity. The overall effect is that the graph indicates whether the singularity is removable without the user having to do any juggling with NaN.\nFor each of the following functions of \\(x\\), use the following procedure:\n\nPlug in the indicated value of \\(x = x^\\star\\) to find out if the computer returns NaN. If so, the function has a singularity at \\(x^\\star\\).\nDraw a graph of the function for a region very close to \\(x^\\star\\) and see if the function behaves smoothly very close to \\(x^\\star\\). If so, find the function’s limit \\(x \\rightarrow x^\\star\\). (Pay attention to the vertical axis scale.)\nLook at the formula for the function to see if there are equal terms in the numerator and the denominator that you can cancel out to create a new function that is the same, everywhere but \\(x^\\star\\), as the original.\n\nExample: \\(f(x) \\equiv \\frac{x^2 + 2x}{x^3 + 4x}\\) at \\(x^\\star = 0\\). The sandbox code has been set up for steps (1) and (2). You will have to do step (3) by hand, using algebra. Notice that f(xstar) returns NaN, indicating that there is a singularity at xstar. The graph, however, is perfectly smooth and has a value of 0.5 at xstar. So the limit \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0.5\\). Using algebra, we can rewrite \\(f(x)\\)\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x}{x^3 + 4x} = \\frac{x}{x} \\frac{x + 2}{x^2 + 4}.\\] Eliminating the \\(\\frac{x}{x}\\), the remainder of the expression evaluates to 1/2 at \\(x=0\\) without any problematic division by zero. This agrees perfectly with the graph made by Active R chunk 10.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 10\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nTrue or false: \\[f(x)\\equiv \\frac{x^2 + 2x}{x^3 - 4x} \\text{ behaves nicely near } x^{\\star} = 0 .\\]\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: NaN-numerics-1\n\n\n\nTrue or false: \\[f(x)\\equiv \\frac{x^2 + 2x}{x^3 - 4x} \\text{ behaves nicely near } x^{\\star} = -2.\\]\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: NaN-numerics-2\n\n\n\nTrue or false: \\[f(x)\\equiv \\frac{x^2 + 2x}{x^3 - 4x} \\text{ behaves nicely near } x^{\\star} = 2.\\]\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: NaN-numerics-3\n\n\n\nTrue or false: \\[f(x)\\equiv \\frac{x^2 + x}{x + \\sqrt{x + 3}} \\text{ behaves nicely near } x^{\\star} = -2.\\]\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: NaN-numerics-4\n\n\n\nTrue or false: \\[f(x)\\equiv x \\log(x) \\text{ behaves nicely when approaching } x^{\\star} = 0 \\text{ from above.}\\]\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: NaN-numerics-5\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8 Consider the function \\(f(x) \\equiv \\frac{x-3}{x-3}\\). Simple algebra suggests that the output will be 1 for any \\(x\\) value input, but the rules are division mean that the output is undefined for input \\(x=3\\). Thus, the function has a “singularity” at \\(x=3\\). We want to test whether this singularity is removable, that is, whether the function has a finite limit as \\(x \\rightarrow 3\\). The computer can help us out. The basic idea is to try inputs closer and closer to \\(x=3\\) and see if the output behaves nicely. To help you distinguish between non-removable and removable singularities (or, in the words of the song “Santa Claus is Coming to Town”, to know “who’s naughty or nice”), Active R chunk 11 defines the function \\(f()\\) and a similar function \\(g()\\). Try out both \\(f()\\) and \\(g()\\) for a sequence of inputs that get closer and closer to \\(x=3\\) but are not exactly 3.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 11\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nEssay 1: Explain what the options(digits=20) statement is doing.

Recall that\n\\[\\partial_x e^x = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{e^{x + h} - e^x}{h} = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} e^x \\frac{e^h - 1}{h} \\]\nSince there is no \\(h\\) in \\(e^x\\), we can pull it out of the limit. \\[\\partial_x e^x = e^x \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{e^h - 1}{h}.\\]\nNow the question of what is the value, if any, of \\(\\frac{e^h + 1}{h}\\)?\nWe can solve this with a simple plot. Active R chunk 12 looks at \\(\\frac{e^h + 1}{h}\\) as a function of \\(h\\), plotting it on a domain where \\(h\\) is “small”.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 12\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nIs the graph behaving nicely as \\(h \\rightarrow 0\\)?

How small can you make \\(h\\) before you run into numerical round-off error? Remember to look carefully at the labels on the vertical axis.\n\n\nExercise 10  \n\nA demonstration that \\(\\partial_x \\sin(x) = \\cos(x)\\) can be made with h-theory. Recall that\n\\[\\partial_x \\sin(x) = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(x + h) - \\sin(x-y)}{2h} \\tag{2}\\]\nAn identity known since before calculus was invented is:\n\\[\\sin(x + h) = \\sin(x)\\cos(h) + \\cos(x)\\sin(h) . \\]\nSimilarly, \\(\\sin(x - h) = \\sin(x)\\cos(h) - \\cos(x)\\sin(h)\\).\nPlugging these identities into Math expression 2 gives\n\\[\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\left[{\\large\\strut} \\sin(x)\\cos(h) + \\cos(x)\\sin(h) - \\left(\\strut\\sin(x)\\cos(h) - \\cos(x)\\sin(h)\\right)\\right]/2h\\]\nThe \\(\\sin(x)\\cos(h)\\) terms cancel out, leaving \\[\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{2\\cos(x) \\sin(h)}{2h} = \\cos(x) \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(h)}{h}\\] where we have used the fact that \\(\\cos(x)\\) does not have any \\(h\\) in it to pull it outside the limit.\nNow the question of what is the value, if any, of \\(\\frac{\\sin(h)}{h}\\)?\nWe can solve this with a simple plot. Active R chunk 13 looks at \\(\\frac{\\sin(h)}{h}\\) as a function of \\(h\\), plotting it on a domain where \\(h\\) is “small”.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 13\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nIs the graph behaving nicely as \\(h \\rightarrow 0\\)?

How small can you make \\(h\\) before you run into numerical round-off error? Remember to look carefully at the labels on the vertical axis.\n\n\nExercise 11 For each exercise, you are given a series of intervals that get smaller and smaller. Your job is to calculate the average rate of change of the function \\(f(x) \\equiv x^2\\) for each of the intervals. As the width of the intervals approach zero, our average rates of change become better approximations of the instantaneous rate of change. You should use the results you calculate to make an informed estimate of the instantaneous rate of change.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nA. Use these three intervals to estimate the instantaneous rate of change \\(\\partial_x f(x=3)\\) - [3, 3.1] - [3, 3.01] - [3, 3.001]\nB. Use these three intervals to estimate the instantaneous rate of change \\(\\partial_x f(x=5)\\) - [4.9, 5] - [4.99, 5] - [4.999, 5]\nC. Use these three intervals to estimate the instantaneous rate of change \\(\\partial_x f(x=-2)\\) - [-2, -1.9] - [-2, -1.99] - [-2, -1.999]\n\n\nExercise 12 Using numerical finite-difference differentiation, confirm the rules given in MOSAIC Calculus Sec 19.3 for the pattern-book functions.\n\nFind a small-enough \\(h\\) so that the error over the domain 0 to 1 is less than \\(10^{-6}\\).\nFind an even smaller \\(h\\) that produces a substantially larger error than in (a).\n\n\n\nExercise 13 Let’s explore the derivative \\(\\partial_x \\frac{1}{x}\\) using the evanescent-h method.\nThe general definition of the derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is the limit as \\(h\\rightarrow 0\\) of a ratio: \\[\\partial_x f(x) \\equiv \\underbrace{\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}}_\\text{limit}\\  \\underbrace{\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}_\\text{ratio}\\ .\\] For an evanescent-h calculation, we put aside for a moment \\(\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\) and operate algebraically on the ratio. In our operations, we treat \\(h\\) as non-zero.\n\nSubstitute in \\(f(x) = 1/x\\) and show step-by-step that the ratio (for non-zero \\(h\\)) is equivalent to \\(- \\frac{1}{x^2 + hx}\\).\nThe domain of the function \\(1/x\\) is the entire number line, except zero. Examine the expression \\(- \\frac{1}{x^2 + hx}\\) to see if setting \\(h\\) to zero would ever involve a division by zero for any \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(1/x\\).\nIf setting \\(h=0\\) cannot cause a division by zero, it is legitimate to do so. Set \\(h=0\\) and simplify the expression \\(- \\frac{1}{x^2 + hx}\\). Compare this to the rule for \\(\\partial_x \\frac{1}{x}\\) given in MOSAIC Calculus Sec 19.3.\n\n\n19-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Your task is to write down the dimension of the input and of the output. Do this both for the function itself, and for the derivative of the function. For example, the dimension of the output of \\(N(y)\\) given below is P, for population. The input has dimension T, for time.\nA. The given function is \\(N(y)\\), the population of the Netherlands in year \\(y\\).\n\nDimension of input to \\(N(y)\\)?\nDimension of output from \\(N(y)\\)?\nDimension of input to \\(\\partial_y N(y)\\)?\nDimension of output from \\(\\partial_y N(y)\\)?\n\nB.

When \\(p=3\\) the rule gives \\[\\partial_x x^3 = 3\\, x^2\\] since \\(p-1\\) will be 2.\nIt is not too hard to do the algebra to find the derivative of \\(x^3\\). According to the proposed rule, the derivative should be \\[\\partial_x x^3 = 3 x^2\\ .\\]\nLet’s check this via the general definition of the derivative: \\[\\partial_x x^3 = \\underbrace{\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}}_\\text{limit}\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{(x+h)^3 - x^3}{h}}_\\text{ratio}\\] In the evanescent-h technique, we put aside the limit for a moment and work algebraically on the ratio with the assumption that \\(h\\neq0\\).\n\nExpand out \\((x+h)(x+h)(x+h) - x^3\\) to get a linear combination of monomials: \\(x^2\\), \\(x^1\\), and \\(x^0\\).\n\n\n\nDivide the linear combination in (a) by \\(h\\) and simplify.\nExamine the expression from (b) to determine if setting \\(h=0\\) will result in a divide-by-zero. What did you find?\n\n\n\nIf your conclusion from (c) is that divide-by-zero does not occur when \\(h=0\\), set \\(h=0\\) and simplify the expression from (b) to find \\(\\partial_x x^3\\). Is your result consistent with the rule for the derivative of power-law functions described at the beginning of this problem.\n\n\n yes        no       \n\nquestion id: kitten-wear-saw-d\n\n\n\n20-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

In transitioning from level flight onto the descent path for landing, for example, pilots take care that the vertical component of acceleration isn’t so great that passengers feel the plane “falling out from under them.”\nA simple model of the descent path is a sigmoid function. Suppose that the descent starts from an altitude of \\(A = 20,000\\) feet at a distance of 30,000 feet from the end of the runway. A reasonable model for the vertical component of the flight path is \\[\\text{altitude}(x) \\equiv A\\,\\pnorm(x,\\ \\  mn=30000/2,\\ \\  sd=30000/6)\\] Notice that the parameter “mean” is set to be half the distance to the runway, and the parameter “sd” is set to be a third of that. This ensures that the start and end of the descent will involve flight that is close to level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A simple model of a the altitude of a airplane as it descends for landing.\n\n\n\nThe vertical acceleration is the second derivative of altitude() with respect to time: \\(\\partial_{tt} \\text{altitude}(t)\\). But notice that altitude() is a function of distance from the runway, not time.\nTo treat altitude() as a function of time, we need to write “distance from the runway” as a function of time. Let’s set \\(t=0\\) to be the time when the plane begins its descent, when it is 30,000 feet from the end of the runway. Distance from the runway will be \\[x(t) = 30000 - v\\, t\\] where \\(v\\) is the plane’s velocity. Composing altitude() onto \\(x(t)\\) gives a new function \\[\\text{alt}(t) \\equiv \\text{altitude}(x(t)) = \\text{altitude}(30000-v\\, t)\\]\nSuppose that the aircraft is flying at \\(v = 200\\) miles-per-hour, which is \\[200  \\frac{\\bcancel{\\text{miles}}}{\\cancel{\\text{hour}}} \\frac{\\cancel{1\\, \\text{hour}}}{3600\\, \\text{s}} \\frac{5280 \\text{ft}}{\\bcancel{1\\, \\text{mile}}} = 293.3 \\frac{\\text{ft}}{\\text{s}}\\]. At that speed, it will take a little more than 100 seconds for the aircraft to reach the runway.\nIn Active R chunk 5 plot out the function alt(\\(t\\)) function, choosing a domain for \\(t\\) that lets you see the whole descent path.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 5\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nCompute the second derivative \\(\\partial_{tt} \\text{alt}(t)\\) to find the vertical component of acceleration of the aircraft. (Important note: Due to a bug in R/mosaic, use numD() rather than D() to compute the second derivative.)\nGraph the second derivative over the appropriate domain and look for the most extreme values of acceleration.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nFrom the graph, read off the maximum vertical acceleration during the descent.\n\nWhat are the units of vertical acceleration shown in the graph?\n\n feet-per-second        feet-per-second-squared        miles-per-hour-squared       \n\nquestion id: descent-path-1\n\n\nA rule of thumb is that a vertical acceleration up to \\(5\\, \\text{ft}\\, \\text{s}^{-2}\\) is acceptable in terms of passenger comfort. Regrettably, the descent path we described does not meet the standard! So we have to re-design the descent path. Since both the altitude and velocity are set, the only parameter you can change is the distance from the foot of the runway where descent commences. Of course, for the parameters “mean” and “sd” need to be set accordingly.\n\nWhat are the units of vertical acceleration shown in the graph?\n\n\n\n feet-per-second\n\n\n feet-per-second-squared\n\n\n miles-per-hour-squared\n\n\n\nquestion id: descent-path-2\n\n\nFor reflection: A new hire at the airline’s operations center proposes to model the descent as a straight-line function rather than a sigmoid. He points out that the second derivative of a straight-line function is always 0, so the passengers would feel no acceleration at all! Explain to this newbie what’s wrong with his idea.\n\n\nExercise 10  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: A drawing from a children’s song book, I’m still here in the bathtub, illustrated by David Catrow. (Scholastic, Inc. 2004)\n\n\n\nThe picture in Figure 6 shows an instantaneous position of the ball. However, such a snapshot does not show the instantaneous velocity of the ball. If you had a few frames of a movie, your intuition would tell you if the ball is likely to go through the hoop. From a movie, you could even calculate a good finite-difference approximation to the instantaneous velocity of the ball. (In Block VI, you’ll see how to use the instantaneous position and velocity to trace out the trajectory of the ball up to the moment it comes into contact with the basket, hoop, or backboard.)\nAssume for the purposes of the following question that the boy, the center of the ball, and the center of the hoop are all in the same plane, as required for a swish shot. Assume as well that when the ball left the boy’s hands it was in the position now occupied by the boy’s head and that there was no spin on the ball. Now the question:\n\nWill the ball swish through the basket?\n\nUse calculus concepts to make a good argument about whether the answer should be “impossible” or “possible.”\n\nThink of the path of the ball as a function \\(f(x)\\), where \\(x\\) is position along the floor and \\(f(x)\\) gives the corresponding height of the ball. Draw some intuitively plausible paths. That is, draw graphs of possible functions consistent with the picture and with the assumption that the launch point is marked by the current position of the boy’s head.\nFrom the picture you can easily find the line connecting the ball’s current position with the launch point. The slope of this line is the average rate of change of ball height with respect to \\(x\\).\nThe physics of ball flight (with no spin) requires the function \\(f(x)\\) to be concave down. How does this restrict the set of possible paths?\n\n\n21-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Solve this by writing \\(x^3\\) as \\(x \\cdot x^2\\) and applying the product rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we already know \\(\\partial_x x\\) (it is 1) and \\(\\partial_x x^2\\) (it is \\(2x\\)) let’s apply the product rule to find \\(\\partial_x x^3\\): \\[\\partial_x [\\color{magenta}x \\times \\color{brown}{x^2}] = \\color{magenta}{[\\partial_x x]} \\times \\color{brown}{x^2} \\ + \\color{magenta}x \\times \\color{brown}{[\\partial_x x^2]} =\\color{magenta}1\\times \\color{brown}{x^2} + \\color{magenta}x \\times \\color{brown}{2x}  = 3 x^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 Recognizing \\(e^{2x}\\) as \\(e^x \\times e^x\\), apply the product rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functions being multiplied are identical: \\(f(x) \\equiv e^x\\) and \\(g(x) \\equiv e^x\\).\nNaturally their derivatives are also identical, and since \\(e^x\\) is involved they will both be \\(e^x\\):\n\\[f'(x) = e^x\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ g'(x) = e^x \\ .\\]\nThe formula for the product rule involves \\(f'() g()\\) and \\(g'() f()\\). Each of these are \\(e^x\\ e^x\\) which is the same as \\(e^{2x}\\). The sum \\(f'() g() + g'() f()\\) is therefore \\(2 e^{2x}\\).\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 Use the chain rule to find the derivative \\(\\partial_x e^{2x}\\).\nHint: The first step is to identify the interior \\(f()\\) and the exterior \\(g()\\) functions. Then differentiate each to get \\(f'()\\) and \\(g()\\) and apply the formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(g(x) \\equiv 2x\\) is the interior function in \\(e^{2x}\\) and \\(f(x) \\equiv \\exp(x)\\) is the exterior function. Thus \\[\\partial_x e^{2x} = f'\\left(\\strut g(x)\\right) g'(x) = \\exp\\left(\\strut g(x)\\right) 2 = 2 e^{2x}\\ .\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn draft\n\n\n\nMake this an exercise in three parts: do the derivative using power-law rules, then using multiplication, then using composition.\n\n\nThere is one family of functions for which function composition accomplishes same thing as multiplying functions: the power-law family.\nConsider, for instance, the function \\(h(x) \\equiv \\left[3x\\right]^4\\). Let’s let \\(g(x) \\equiv 3x\\) and \\(f(y) \\equiv y^4\\). With these definitions, \\(h(x) = f(g(x))\\).\nRecognizing that \\(\\partial_y f(y) = 4 y^3\\) and \\(\\partial_x g(x) = 3\\), the chain rule gives \\[\\partial_x h(x) =\n\\underbrace{4 g(x)^3}_{f'(g(x))} \\times \\underbrace{3}_{g'(x)} = \\underbrace{4 (3 x)^3}_{f'(g(x))} \\times 3 = 4\\cdot 3^4 \\times x^3 = 324\\ x^3\\] Another way to look at the same function is \\(g(x)\\) multiplied by itself 3 times: \\[h(x) = g(x)\\cdot g(x) \\cdot g(x) \\cdot g(x)\\] This is a product of 4 terms. Applying the product rule gives \\[\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_x h(x) &=& \\color{blue}{g'(x)}\\cdot g(x)\\cdot g(x) \\cdot g(x) +\\\\\n&\\ & g(x)\\cdot \\color{blue}{g(x)}'\\cdot g(x) \\cdot g(x) +\\\\\n&\\ & g(x)\\cdot g(x)\\cdot \\color{blue}{g(x)'} \\cdot g(x) +\\\\\n&\\ & g(x)\\cdot g(x)\\cdot g(x) \\cdot \\color{blue}{g'(x)}\n\\end{eqnarray}\\] Since multiplication is commutative, all four terms are the same, each being \\(3^4 x^3\\). The sum of all four is therefore \\(4 \\times 3^4 x^3 = 324 x^3\\).\nThese are two long-winded ways of getting to the result. For most people, differentiating power-law functions algebraically is simplified by using the rules of exponentiation rather than the product or chain rule. Here, \\[h(x) \\equiv \\left[3x\\right]^4 = 3^4 x^4\\]so \\(\\partial_x h(x)\\) is easily handled as a scalar (\\(3^4\\)) times a function \\(x^4\\). Consequently, applying the rule for differentiating power laws, \\[\\partial_x h(x) = 3^4 \\times \\partial_x x^4 = 3^4 \\times 4 x^3 = 324 x^3\\] As another example, take \\(h(x) \\equiv \\sqrt[4]{\\strut x^3}\\). This is, of course, the composition \\(f(g(x))\\) where \\(f(y) \\equiv y^{1/4}\\) and \\(g(x) \\equiv x^3\\). Applying the chain rule to find \\(\\partial_x h(x)\\) will work (of course!), but is more work than applying the rules of exponentiation followed by a simple power-law differentiation. \\[h(x) = \\sqrt[4]{\\strut x^3} = x^{3/4}\\ \\ \\text{so}\\ \\  \\partial_x h(x) = \\frac{3}{4} x^{(3/4 - 1)} = \\frac{3}{4} x^{-1/4}\\]\n\n23-review.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

So a product of three functions can be seen as a product \\(u\\cdot h\\) where \\(h \\equiv v \\cdot w\\).\n\n\nExercise 7 In Exercise 7 you constructed models \\(D(t)\\) of the availability of a drug in the bloodstream for three different pill-taking regimens: every six hours, every eight hours, and a double dose to start followed by a single dose every eight hours. The model for from a single, isolated pill is a zero before the pill is taken, then exponential decay from the level of the pill dose after the pill is taken. Like this:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe parameter \\(k\\) has been set to represent a drug with a half-life of three hours.\nThe model for the entire regiment is a linear combination of time-shifted single pills, e.g.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFrom graphs of the functions themselves it is easy to check whether the availability ever falls below the therapeutic threshold (which we stipulated is 0.25). For instance, the eight-hour regiment with a dose of A=1 does fall below the threshold during the first day. So a larger dose is needed than A=1.\nA primary objective in choosing a drug regime is to ensure that the availability stays above the therapeutic level. A secondary objective is to keep the elimination rate small so that the drug can be handled by patients with poorly functioning livers.\nThe derivative \\(\\partial_t \\text{regimen8}(t)\\) tells the instantaneous rate at which the drug is being administered to and eliminated from the patient’s body. This is the reason for using the name elimination() for the function created in Active R chunk 2.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nFor each of the three regimens—6-hour, 8-hour, 8-hour-double-first-dose—construct \\(\\partial_t \\text{regimen}(t)\\).

A monotonically decreasing function, similarly, has a negative slope everywhere in the domain.

As you know, cardboard boxes have four sides as well as eight flaps, four for the top and four for the bottom. The flaps are arranged to provide double coverage; you fold the flaps from one direction and then fold over them the flaps from the other direction.\n\n The diagram depicts the box sides and flaps laid out on a flat piece of cardboard. The flaps are shaded with diagonal lines. The formulas give the areas of various rectangles on the sheet.\n\nSuppose the height, width, and depth of the box are \\(h\\), \\(w\\), and \\(d\\) respectively. The box volume is easy:\n\\[V = h w d\\] The area of cardboard consists of the the four sides and the eight flaps. Each component’s area is a product of the two edge lengths. For example, the box sides are either \\(w h\\) or \\(d h\\). The flaps, each of which extends half-way across the bottom or top have areas \\(w d/2\\).\n\nWhich of these formulas gives the area of the cardboard making up the box?\n\n\n\n \\(2 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(4 h(w + d) + 2 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 h(w + d) + 8 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(4 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-1\n\n\nA common size for a box is 1.3 cubic feet. We will use feet as the units for \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\).\n\nThe following formulas do not describe the area of the cardboard, but they are nonetheless formulas for something. Except one of them, which cannot be true. Which one?\n\n\n\n \\(h(w + d)/d + w d^2/h\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w + d) + w h d\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w + d) + w^2 h/d\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w^2/d + d) + d^2\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-2\n\n\nAs \\(w\\), \\(h\\), or \\(d\\) are changed, the volume and surface area of the box are changed. Asking for the \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\) that minimize the surface area of the box is not a complete statement of a problem. The minimum surface area will be zero whenever two of the three dimensions have length zero. In other words, we can minimize the surface area by making a box that is no box at all!\nTo complete the problem statement we need something else. Here, that something is a constraint: We demand that the box have a volume of \\(V = 1.3\\) cubic feet.\nOften, a constraint plays the role of a dimension reduction. With \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\), we have a 3-input optimization problem. But we can use the constraint equation to solve for one of the quantities as a function of the others and the (known) volume. For instance, we can find \\(h\\) as \\[h = V/d w\\]\n\nPlug in the above expression for \\(h\\) into the formula for the surface area of cardboard. Which of the following is the resulting formula in terms of \\(w\\), \\(d\\), and \\(V\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(2 V(w + d)/wd + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(V(w + d)/w + V(w+d)/d  + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 w d (w + d)/V + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 (w + d)/wd + 4 V w d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-3\n\n\nActive R chunk 1 contains the formula for the surface area \\(A(w, d, V)\\) of a box of volume \\(V\\).

Towards the upper-right and lower-left corners of the plot frame are contours at higher levels of area.\n\nThe spacing between the contours in the corners is tight, but there is no similarly spaced contour inside the region delimited by the contour at area=9.5. Why not?\n\n\n\n We didn’t ask for contours inside 9.5.\n\n\n The function shape inside the 9.5 contour is the top of a bowl, so it is pretty flat.\n\n\n The function shape inside the 9.5 contour is the bottom of a bowl, so it is pretty flat.\n\n\n All the points inside the 9.5 contour are at the same height.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-4\n\n\nUse Active R chunk 1 to place contours at 10, 9.5, 9.4. You can do this by replacing the argument contours_at = NULL with this:\ncontours_at = c(10, 9.5, 9.4))\nAdd more contours to build a fence tighter and tighter around the argmin. When the fenced region is tiny, you can read off the min from the contour label. (Remember, the “argmin” is the value of the inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) at which the function is minimized. The “min” is the value of the function at the argmin.) But watch out as you do this. If you ask for a contour at a level that is lower than the min, it will simply not be drawn. Or, more precisely, there are no inputs that produce an output that is lower than the min. So you may have to change the interval between levels (e.g. 10, 9.5, 9.4, …) to home in on the argmin.\n\nThe following are values for the output of the function where you might be able to draw a contour. Which one of the values is the smallest for which a contour appears?\n\n\n 9.1        9.05        9.01        9.005        9.0005        9       \n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-5\n\n\n\nFrom your contour plot, read off the values of \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) that produce the minimum surface area for a 1.3 cubic-foot box.

But this is not feasible if there are more than two inputs to the function being optimized. For such functions, another set of numerical techniques are used based on the gradient of the objective function. Remember that the gradient at any point is a vector that points in the uphill direction and whose length is proportional to the steepness of the slope. (Skiers, beware. In skiing what people call the gradient is the steepest downhill direction. This might account for all the mathematicians learning to ski who point their skis uphill in response to the ski instructor’s instruction!)\nYou can display the gradient on the plot of the area function by piping (remember |&gt;) the contour plot into the commented-out command in the sandbox. (Also, replace #pipe to with |&gt;.)\n\nSince the end of the term is coming, here is a question that might be a good review for the final. Which of these describes the relationship between the gradient vector and the contours?\n\n\n\n On a contour the gradient vector is perpendicular (“orthogonal”) to the contour.\n\n\n On a contour, the gradient vector has zero length.\n\n\n There is no definite relationship; it depends on the function itself.\n\n\n On a contour, the gradient vector has a length proportional to the contour level.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-7\n\n\n\nWhich of these best describes the gradient vector at the argmin?\n\n\n\n The gradient points due North.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is maximal.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is minimal.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is zero.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-8\n\n\nMany numerical optimization techniques are based on the idea like this: treating the field of gradient vectors as a flow field in a differential equation. Starting at some initial value, follow the gradient vectors (as you did in sketching the trajectory in a flow field). If seeking a maximum, the flow will be in the direction of the gradient. If seeking a minimum, the flow will be opposite the direction of the gradient. It is not necessary to calculate the gradient everywhere; you just have to calculate it at the present point on your trajectory to know which way to go next.\nOccasionally, particularly in textbook problems, the argmin or argmax is found algebraically. This still involves calculating the gradient as a function of the inputs. Then, find the inputs that make all the components of the gradient vector zero.\n\nWhich of these formulas give the gradient vector of \\(A(w, d)\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 w\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2} - 4 w\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 d\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w} - 4 d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-9\n\n\n\nIf the lengths \\(w\\), \\(d\\), \\(h\\) are measured in feet, what unit will \\(\\partial_w A\\) be in?\n\n\n feet        square feet        cubic feet        1/feet        dimensionless       \n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-10\n\n\nFor those of you who are pining for algebra problems, here you go.\nTaking the gradient of \\(A(w, d)\\) (given in a previous question), set both components to zero, giving you two equations in the two variables \\(w\\) and \\(d\\). There is also a \\(V\\) in the equations, but we’ve set up the problem saying that we already know \\(V\\). Numerically, we used \\(V=1.3\\) cubic-feet, but in the algebra solution we can just leave \\(V\\) as a symbol, giving general formulas for \\(w\\) and for \\(d\\) in terms of \\(V\\).\n\nWhich of these is the correct formula for the optimal \\(w^\\star\\) as a function of \\(V\\)?

(An experienced algebraist would have noticed that in the formula for area, you can swap inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) without changing the output.)\nNow compute the formula for the optimal value \\(h^\\star\\).

So we can make \\(h\\) larger without contributing to the “wasted” area of the doubling over of flaps. The flaps get smaller as \\(wd\\) gets smaller, so larger \\(h\\) is preferred.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-13\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3 You and your pet dog Swimmer often go to the beach and walk along the water’s edge. You throw a ball down the beach, but at an angle so it lands in the water. Swimmer goes to work. She runs down the beach (fast) and then plunges into the water, heading toward the ball. She can run fast on the beach: 400 m/minute. But she swims rather slower: 50 m/min.\nSuppose you threw the ball to a point about 50 meters down the beach and 10 meters out in the water. The overall distance to the ball is therefore \\(\\sqrt{50^2 + 10^2} \\approx 51\\) meters. If Swimmer entered the water immediately, she would take about a minute to reach the ball (51 m / 50 m/min). Swimmer can get to the ball faster by running down the beach a bit and then turning into the water. If Swimmer ran all 50 meters down the beach and then turned to swim the 10 meters, it would take her (50/400 + 10/50) minutes, about one-third of a minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Swimmer’s optimal path to the ball consists of running \\(x\\) meters along the shore, then swimming diagonally to the ball.\n\n\n\nCan Swimmer do better? You can set up the calculation like this. Imagine \\(x\\) to be the distance down the beach that Swimmer runs. The time to run this distance will be \\(x/400\\). The distance remaining to the ball can be found by the Pythagorean theorem. One leg of the triangle has length \\((50-x)\\), the other has length 10 m. So, the length of the third side is \\(\\sqrt{\\strut (50-x)^2 + 10^2}\\). For instance, if \\(x\\) were 45, the distance to swim in the water would be \\(\\sqrt{(50-45)^2 + 10^2} = 11.2\\) m. Divide this distance by 50 m/min to get the time spent in the water.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nTime_to_ball() takes one argument, the distance \\(x\\) Swimmer runs down the beach before turning into the water. Complete and use Active R chunk 2 to find the distance that calculus-savvy Swimmer runs down the beach before turning into the water, if Swimmer’s goal is to get to the ball as fast as possible.\nWhat’s the optimal running distance for Swimmer?\n\n 46.75        47.5        48.75        49.75       \n\nquestion id: optim-violet-1\n\n\nHere’s a news story about a mathematician’s dog on the shore of Lake Michigan. It is not plausible that Swimmer has been trained in calculus. Perhaps the way Swimmer solves the running distance problem is simply to graph time_to_ball(x) ~ x over a suitable domain and find the argmax by eye!\n\n\nExercise 4 If you’re skeptical that a dog might do a calculus problem (as in Exercise 3) before running to fetch a ball, consider the path taken by a photon. “Fermat’s Principle” is that light takes the path of least time. To illustrate, consider the problem of a photon traveling from a point A to a point B, as in the diagram. The shortest path between the two points is a straight line. Along this straight-line path, the time taken by the photon will be the distance divided by the speed of light.\nThe diagram shows another path consisting of two segments, one of length \\(l_1\\) and the other \\(l_2\\). Obviously, the two-segment path is longer than the straight-line path. But according to Fermat’s principle, light “prefers” the longer path if the time taken to traverse it is shorter. This phenomenon is called refraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Refraction of light on the path from A to B through a change in medium.\n\n\n\nThe reason the indirect path might be shorter is that the speed of light differs in different physical media. Light traveling in a vacuum famously has a speed of about 300,000 km per second. In air, the speed is smaller by a factor of 1/1.003. In water, the speed is smaller still: the factor is 1/1.3.\nImagine that the blue zone of the diagram is water and the clear zone air. The time for the photon to travel from point A to B is proportional to \\(1.003\\ l_1 + 1.3\\ l_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nTo see the path taken by light, let’s imagine that point A is \\((x=0, y=10)\\) and point B is \\((x=20, y=-10)\\), and that the boundary between water and air is at \\(y=0\\). We will place the point P at \\((x, 0)\\). The total time taken for light to traverse this path is 1.003 dist(A to P) + 1.3 dist(P to B).\n\nWhich of these formulas gives the total time it takes for light to traverse the path from A to P at relative speed 1/1.003 and then the path from P to B at relative speed 1/1.3?

Functions are used to define the top and bottom surface of the lens. Light passing through the lens is refracted. The path followed by the light will be the one with the shortest time of transit from source to target. But Active R chunk 4 initially is set up to trace a non-optimal, out-of-the-way path running through \\(x_{in}=10\\) on the bottom to \\(x_{out}=5\\) on the top.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 4\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nNote: The plot_lens() function has been provided for you, but it’s too computer-ese to bother showing you with how it’s defined.\nThe light enters the lens at some point \\(P_{in} = (x_{in}\\ , \\ -\\text{Lens}(x_{in}))\\) and leaves at \\(P_{out} = (x_{out}\\ ,\\  \\text{Lens}(x_{out}))\\). We don’t know either \\(x_{in}\\) or \\(x_{out}\\). but we can find them by optimization.\nTo do this, we find the distance from the source to \\(P_{in}\\), and from \\(P_{out}\\) to the target. These two legs of the route are through air, so the time of transit on each leg is proportional to the refractive index 1.03 times the distance.\nOf course, light also has to travel through the lens. We will make the lens out of glass with a high refractive index, so the transit time will be the distance from \\(P_{in}\\) to \\(P_{out}\\) multiplied by the lens’s refractive index, which we’ll set to be 1.8.\nThe objective function will be the sum of the three legs’ transit times. It is already programmed for you in the sandbox. So is the command to make a contour plot of the output of the objective function over a domain of \\(x_{in}\\) and \\(x_{out}\\). Finally, the last line in ?lst-optim-purpose draws a picture of the lens and the light path, but you will have to insert the argmins \\(x_{in}\\) and \\(x_{out}\\) that you pick from the contour plot of the objective function.

Explain briefly which part of the lens these two minima correspond to. Hint: High index means slow speed of light.

(Hint: Remember that \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) are specified as being positive.)\n\n\n\n If \\(\\partial_F M()\\) is an increasing function of \\(L\\), then \\(\\partial_L M()\\) must be a decreasing function of \\(F\\).\n\n\n If \\(\\partial_F M()\\) is an increasing function of \\(L\\), then \\(\\partial_L M()\\) must be an increasing function of \\(F\\).\n\n\n Neither of the above needs to be true.\n\n\n\nquestion id: rooster-red-3\n\n\nThink now about the general’s statement and how to translate it into mathematical terms. Here’s a hint: Imagine Drew has very high \\(F\\) score and low \\(L\\) score. Consider another cadet, Blake, with scores \\(F-\\epsilon\\) and \\(L + \\epsilon\\). Blake’s flying and leadership scores are closer together than Drew’s. Both Drew and Blake have the same average of \\(F\\) and \\(L\\). But would the general find Blake superior or inferior to Drew? If superior, then you would want \\(\\partial_L M &gt; \\partial_F M\\). If inferior, then your model should have \\(\\partial_L M &lt; \\partial_F M\\). If the general would be indifferent between Drew and Blake, then the two partial derivatives should be equal.\n\nBased on the general’s statement, do you want \\(d_{12}\\) to be positive, negative, or zero?\n\n\n\n Positive\n\n\n Zero\n\n\n Negative\n\n\n It has nothing to do with the general’s statement.\n\n\n\nquestion id: rooster-red-4\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8 Based on an extensive but fictive observation of activity and grades of college students, the model shown in Figure 4 was constructed to give GPA as a function of the number of hours each weekday (Monday-Friday) spent studying and spent in social activity and play.

There are many ways to perform the work to extract the argmax once the objective function and constraints are set.\nUnderstandably, calculus textbooks tend to emphasize techniques based on finding an input where the derivative of the objective function is zero. For problems involving multiple inputs, the task is to find an input where the gradient vector is zero.\nContemporary work often involves problems with tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of inputs. Even in such large problems, the mechanics of finding the corresponding gradient vector are straightforward. Searching through a high-dimensional space, however, is not generally a task that can be accomplished using calculus tools. Instead, starting in the 1940s, great creativity has been applied to develop algorithms with names like linear programming, quadratic programming, dynamic programming, etc. many of which are based on ideas from linear algebra such as the qr.solve() algorithm for solving the target problem, or ideas from statistics and statistical physics that incorporate randomness as an essential component. An entire field, operations research, focuses on setting up and solving such problems. Building appropriate algorithms requires deep understanding of several areas of mathematics. But using the methods is mainly a matter of knowing how to set up the problem and communicate the objective function, constraints, etc. to a computer.\nPurely as an example, let’s examine the operation of an early algorithmic optimization method: Nelder-Mead, dating from the mid-1960s. (There are better, faster methods now, but they are harder to understand.)\nNelder-Mead is designed to search for maxima of objective functions with \\(n\\) inputs. The video shows an example with \\(n=2\\) in the domain of a contour plot of the objective function. Of course, you can simply scan the contour plot by eye to find the maxima and minima. The point here is to demonstrate the Nelder-Mead algorithm.\nStart by selecting \\(n+1\\) points on the domain that are not colinear. When \\(n=2\\), the \\(2+1\\) points are the vertices of a triangle. The set of points defines a simplex, which you can think of as a region of the domain that can be fenced off by connecting the vertices.\nEvaluate the objective function at the vertices of the simplex. One of the vertices will have the lowest score for the output of the objective. From that vertex, project a line through the midpoint of the fence segment defined by the other \\(n\\) vertices. In the video, this is drawn using dashes. Then try a handful of points along that line, indicated by the colored dots in the video. One of these will have a higher score for the objective function than the vertex used to define the line. Replace that vertex with the new, higher-scoring point. Now you have another simplex and can repeat the process. The actual algorithm has additional rules to handle special cases, but the gist of the algorithm is simple.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11 When we locate an argmax, it’s helpful to have some guidance about how much precision make practical sense. We can figure this out using the second derivative of the function at the argmax.\nConsider a function f(x) and its curvature at an argmax. The curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of a circle tangent to the function. That circle approximates the function itself. At an argmax, the highest point in the circle will be right on the function. But a few degrees to either side of the highest point will be very close to the highest point. How wide will the chord of the circle be that connects the points 5 degrees to either side of the highest point? Your answer will involve sin() but also the curvature of the function.\n\n24-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

    "text": "Reading question 25.1 Which of the following is the correct interpretation of \\(\\nabla f()\\)?\n\n\n The function that is the finite-difference derivative of \\(f()\\).\n\n\n The function that is the anti-difference of \\(f()\\).\n\n\n The function that is the gradient of \\(f()\\).\n\n\n The function that is the inverse of \\(f()\\).\n\n\n\nquestion id: nabla-meaning\n\n\n\n\nReading question 25.2 On a contour plot of a function \\(f(x,y)\\), an argmax will be located inside the set of concentric contours that show the sides of a “mountain.” At this argmax, what will the value of the gradient vector \\(\\nabla f(x,y)\\) be. (Hint: You don’t need to know a specific \\(f()\\), just that you are evaluating the gradient at an argmax.)\n\n\n\nReading question 25.3 For a function \\(f(x,y)\\) with two inputs, a contour plot shows where in \\((x,y)\\) space the function output takes on specific values. Imagine a single contour, perhaps one with a circular shape. How will the gradient vector \\(\\nabla f(x,y)\\) evaluated at a point on the contour be related to the curve of the contour going through that point.\n\n\n\nReading question 25.4 For a function \\(g(x,y,z)\\) the analog of a contour is three-dimensional. For instance, the 3-d “contour” can be likened to the surface of a balloon positioned in an \\((x, y, z)\\) space.\n\nHow will the gradient vector \\(\\nabla g(x,y,z)\\) evaluated at a point on the contour balloon be related to the surface of the balloon?\n\n\n\nClose enough to a point on the balloon’s surface, it resembles a planar surface (locally). Take a book and lean it up against something else so that the cover is neither vertical nor horizontal. Now put a pencil’s eraser end at a point on the book cover and orient the pencil to be perpendicular to the cover. Is there a unique orientation that achieves this, or are there multiple, different orientations?\n\n\n\n\nReading question 25.5 The gradient \\(\\nabla g(x, y, z)\\) is, as the notation suggests, a function with three inputs, x, y, and z. Write \\(\\nabla g(x, y, z)\\) as a coordinate triple, where each component of the triple is the partial derivative of \\(g()\\) with respect to one of the inputs.\nEvaluating the coordinate triple for a specific input, say \\(x=2, y=1.5, z=3\\), will give three numbers as output. You are acquainted with such triples as representing position in space, e.g. \\((2, 1.5, 3)\\). For vectors, however, it is conventional to write the components one on top of the other in a column, like this: \\[\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\partial_x g(2, 1.5, 3)\\\\ \\partial_y g(2, 1.5, 3)\\\\ \\partial_z g(2, 1.5, 3)\\end{array}\\right). \\tag{25.1}\\]\nIt might look at first glance like the three components in Math expression 25.1 are identical to one another. Explain, in typographical terms, what’s different about the components.\n\nNote: Our physical representation of a position in space is a “point,” drawn as a dot. For vectors, our physical representation is a pencil or arrow with the sharp end pointing forward.\n\n25-reading.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

In one of the questions, you will extend the formula with a - 1 (which suppresses the intercept term that is ordinarily included in models).\nFor each of the following essays, copy the code in Active R chunk 3 to the new, empty chunk, then modify the model specification as explained in the essay prompt.\nEssay 1: The lm() function automatically adds an \"intercept\" term to the model. You can suppress this by ending the model formula with -1. Explain briefly what happens when you suppress the intercept and to what extent that model makes sense for the bicycle situation.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 4\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nEssay: The interaction term in the model is included by the + I(s*g) component of the model formula. (Don’t get confused: \"Interaction\" and \"intercept\" are completely different things.) Take out the interaction term, refit and re-display the model. Explain briefly what happens when you suppress the interaction term and to what extent that model makes sense for the bicycle situation.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 5\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nEssay 3: Suppose you add in a quadratic term in s to the model. Explain briefly whether this changes the model a lot or not. Also, look at the coefficients found by lm() for this extended model. What about those coefficients accounts for whether the model changed by a little or a lot.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 6\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at things a different way. Instead of each slice holding road slope constant and showing velocity as a function of gear, define a new function bike_plot2() which holds gear constant in each slice and varies road slope instead. You can do this by copying and modifying the bike_plot() function defined in Active R chunk 4. Do this\nEssay 4: Re-run the various model-display chunks, including the new bike_plot2() display. Explain in everyday terms what this new plot displays about the models and say whether you think it makes sense.",

But with \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} x \\ln(x)\\) we have a situation of \\(0 \\times \\infty\\). However, \\[x \\ln(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{1/x}\\] which makes it clearer that \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} x \\ln(x)\\) is a matter of comparing the two functions \\(\\ln(x)\\) and \\(1/x\\). The limit \\(x \\rightarrow 0\\) is of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is \\(-\\infty\\) while for \\(1/x\\) it is \\(\\infty\\). Thus we have a indeterminate form problem of \\(-\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}\\). This can be handled by l’Hopital’s Rule.\nHere, the rule has the form:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\left[ \\frac{\\ln(x)}{1/x} \\right] = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\left[\\frac{\\partial_x \\ln(x)}{\\partial_x 1/x}\\right] \\tag{1}\\]\nCompute the derivatives on the right-hand side of Math expression 1 and simplify the algebra.\n\nWhat does \\[\\left[\\frac{\\partial_x \\ln(x)}{\\partial_x 1/x}\\right]\\] simplify to?\n\n\n \\(x\\)        \\(-x\\)        \\(1/x\\)        \\(-1/x\\)       \n\nquestion id: dolphin-mean-linen-2\n\n\nTake the limit as \\(x \\rightarrow 0\\) of the simplifed form.

Instead, we will have to use just a few coefficients. But how many is enough?\nThe function make_poly() defined in Active R chunk 2 can create a function given a fiducial point \\(x_0\\) and a few coefficients at the start of the Taylor polynomial.\nFor example, the coefficients for \\(e^x\\) (around \\(x_0 = 0\\)) are \\(1, 1, 1/2, 1/6, 1/24, 1/120, 1/720, 1/5040, 1/40320, 1/362880, ...\\) Factorials get big fast!\nThe sandbox shows a simple comparison of the polynomial approximation to the actual exponential function. it plots the magnitude of the error \\(|e^x - p(x)|\\) on a log-log scale.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nRead the graph carefully to make sure you understand what is being displayed.\n\nIt is easy to think about the “absolute error” scale as indicating the number of zeros after the decimal point in the size of the error. For example 1e-6 is 0.000001. The approximation has that much error or less for \\(|x| &lt; 0.3\\).\nWe are using log-log scales because we anticipated that the error would be something like a power law. (Why? Because the first term omitted from the approximation will produce a function \\(a_{n+1} x^{n+1}\\), a power law. And when a power-law function is plotted on log-log axes, it appears as a straight line.) But we cannot graph negative values of \\(x\\) on a log scale. So we are plotting both \\(p(x)\\) and \\(p(-x)\\) together. The error for negative \\(x\\) values are plotted in red.\n\nFor \\(x \\approx 2.0\\), the magnitude of the error is, to judge from the graph, 1e-1.

It will help to see the relationships if we write each of them in a common form. To that end, we will write each as a linear combination of power-law functions with integer exponents.

The key to success is to write the Taylor polynomial for functions such as \\(\\sin(x)\\) or \\(x\\) or \\(x^2\\) near \\(x_0 = 0\\). Such polynomials will always look like:\n\\[f(x) = a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \\cdots\\]\nWhat’s special here is that the a_0 term does not need to be included in the polynomial, since \\(f(0) = 0\\).\n\nOne of these functions has a Taylor polynomial at \\(x_0 = 0\\) the does need a non-zero \\(a_0\\) term. The other’s don’t. Which function needs the non-zero \\(a_0\\) term?\n\n\n\n sin()\n\n\n tan()\n\n\n atan()\n\n\n acos()\n\n\n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-toss-gloves-4\n\n\nThese zero divided by zero problems (like \\(\\sin(x) / x\\)) always involve a ratio of two functions (\\(\\sin(x)\\) and \\(x\\) here) that don’t need the \\(a_0\\) term in their Taylor series around \\(x_0 = 0\\). That makes them just a little bit simpler.\nWhat’s more important than simpler is that, for the expansion of such functions to study the limit at \\(x \\rightarrow 0\\), we only need the first term with a non-zero coefficient \\(a_k\\) to represent the function with complete accuracy.\nWhy? Consider the 2nd-order Taylor polynomial \\(a_1 x + a_2 x^2\\). If we are to be able to safely disregard the \\(a_2\\) term it is because that term, for small \\(x\\) is much, much smaller than the \\(a_1 x\\) term. And we can always choose non-zero \\(x\\) to make this so.\nFor instance, suppose our polynomial were \\(x + 100 x^2\\). For \\(x=0.1\\), the first and second terms are the same size; we need them both for accuracy. For \\(x=0.01\\), the second term is 1/100 the size of the first term, maybe we don’t need the second term so much. You can always make \\(x\\) so small that anyone will be satisfied that the second term is utterly negligible compared to the first.\nHere’s the method:\nSuppose you have a function \\(f(x) \\equiv u(x)/v(x)\\) where \\[\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} u(x) = 0\\ \\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\ \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} v(x) = 0\\] Given this, \\(f(0)\\) is not defined. But we can ask whether there is a sensible value that can be plugged in in place of \\(f(0)\\) that will cause the modified \\(f()\\) to be continuous at \\(x=0\\).\nStep 1: Write the Taylor polynomial expansion around \\(x-0 = 0\\) for both \\(u(x)\\) and \\(v(x)\\). If both expansions have a non-zero first coefficient, you can stop there. Now we have:\n\\[u(x) \\approx a_1 x\\] \\[v(x) \\approx b_1 x\\] where \\(a_1 = \\partial_x u(0)\\) and \\(b_1 = \\partial_x v(0)\\).\nStep 2: Divide the polynomial (really just linear!) expansion of \\(u()\\) by the expansion of \\(v()\\) to get\n\\[\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{u(x)}{v(x)} = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{a_1 x}{b_1 x} = \\frac{a_1}{b_1}\\]\nthat is the answer, \\(a_1/b_1\\), at least when \\(b_1 \\neq 0\\). We will come back to that case later.\n\nFor \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\sin(x) / x\\), what are \\(a_1\\) and \\(b_1\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(a_1 = 1\\) and \\(b_1 = 1\\)\n\n\n \\(a_1 = \\pi\\) and \\(b_1 = \\pi\\)\n\n\n \\(a_1 = -1\\) and \\(b_1 = -1\\)\n\n\n \\(a_1 = 0\\) and \\(b_1 = -1\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-toss-gloves-5\n\n\nSometimes the singularity is at some non-zero \\(x\\). For instance, \\[h(x) \\equiv \\frac{x^2 - 16}{x - 4}\\] The divide-by-zero comes into play when \\(x=4\\). So is there a sensible value to plug in for \\(h(4)\\) to replace the singularity.\nHere, write your Taylor polynomials around \\(x_0 = 4\\), the location of the singularity. We will get:\n\\[x^2 - 16 = a_1 (x-4) + a_2 (x-4)^2 + \\cdots\\] \\[x - 4 = b_1 (x-4)\\] Using Taylor’s formula for coefficients we will get \\[a_1 = \\partial_x (x^2 - 16)\\left.\\right|_{x=4} = 2x\\left.\\right|_{x=4} = 8\\] \\[b_1 = \\partial_x (x - 4) = 1\\]\nConsequently, \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 4} \\frac{x^2 - 16}{x - 4} = 8\\)\nWe’ve been discussing ratios of functions where the ratio cannot be calculated at the singularity using simply the limits of the functions approaching that singularity. (For instance \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\sin(x) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} x = 0\\), but knowing this does not tell us what \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\) will be. These are called “indeterminate forms.” As you’ve seen, if we know more about the functions than merely their individual limits, we can sometimes resolve the indeterminacy. Here we are doing that by writing each function as a low-order polynomial.\nThe indeterminate form \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\) might be said to have the “shape” 0/0. But 0/0 is just a notation about the limits of the two individual functions. There are indeterminate forms with other shapes: \\[\\frac{0}{0}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 0\\cdot {\\infty\\ \\ \\ \\  \\ 0^0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\infty^0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 1^\\infty\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\infty - \\infty}\\] Keep in mind that something like \\(0 \\infty\\) is not a multiplication problem but rather shorthand for \\(u(x) v(x)\\) where \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow x_0} u(x) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow x_0} v(x) \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nThere is a variety of algebraic tricks to try to transform these different shapes of indeterminate forms into a ratio of functions, each of which goes to zero at the relevant \\(x_0\\). Once that is done, you can apply the method described above.\nIndeterminate forms have been a bonanza for the author of calculus book exercises, who can write an large number of examples, many of which have never been seen in the wild.\nOne shortcut that works in practice is to make a graph of the indeterminate form near the singularity. If the limit as \\(x\\) approaches the singularity is a finite number, you can read off the result from the graph.\nIn Active R chunk 5, the function \\(g(x)\\equiv x \\ln(x)\\) is set up. This function has a singularity at \\(x=0\\). Examine the plot and determine where the function value is going as you walk along the graph to the singularity.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 5\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 10 In this exercise, you’re going to approximate a sinusoid \\(sin(x)\\) with polynomials of order 3, 5, and 7. The approximation should go exactly through the coordinate pair \\((x_0=0, y=0)\\) shown as a bright dot on the graph. Notice that the approximation is exacty tangent to the sinusoid at \\(x_0 = 0\\): the approximating line goes straight through the dot and continues pretty much through the center of the thick line marking the sinusoid, until the sinusoid curves away from the straight line.\n\n\nWarning: All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 101 rows.\nℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n  a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw your own graph of a sinusoid so that you can sketch on top of it the polynomial approximations you will design.\nStart with sketching in a third-order polynomial that approximates the sinusoid near \\(x_0=0\\). The general formula for a third order polynomial is \\[\\text{third}(x) \\equiv \\overbrace{\\underbrace{b_0 + b_1 x^1}_\\text{first-order polynomial} + b_2 x^2}^\\text{second-order polynomial} + b_3 x^3\\] To turn the first-order approximation into a third-order approximation algebraically, you would need to choose the coefficients \\(b_2\\) and \\(b_3\\). You want to choose the best possible \\(b_2\\) and \\(b_3\\) to stay close to the sinusoid. Of course, you could take the lazy person’s approach and choose \\(b_2 = b_3 = 0\\). If you did that, you would have the first-order polynomial. Here’s the important point: the best third-order polynomial will not be any worse than the first-order polynomial, but it can be better!\nRemember what you know about the shape of third-order polynomials:\n\nOne tail will go up, the other down.\nThere can be both an argmin and an argmax.\n\nRepeat (1), sketching out a 5th-order polynomial. Again, one tail will go up and the other down. But now there can be two argmaxes and two argmins that alternate along the \\(x\\) axis: min, max, min, max.\nOne more time, sketching now a 7th-order polynomial. Just like the first-, third-, and fifth-order polynomial, for the 7th one tail will go up and the other down. There can be as many as three argmaxes and three argmins. They will alternate: between any two argmaxes, there will be one argmin.\n\n\n\nExercise 11 We would like to write a Taylor-series polynomial for \\(\\dnorm(x)\\). To do this, we will need the folling numbers \\[\\dnorm(x_0),\\ \\ \\partial_x \\dnorm(x_0),\\ \\ \\partial_{xx} \\dnorm(x_0),\\ \\ \\partial_{xxx} \\dnorm(x_0), ...\\]\n\n(To warm up.) Why did I call the forms like \\(\\partial_{xxx} \\dnorm(x_0)\\) a number rather than a function?\n\n\n\n Because partial derivatives are numbers.\n\n\n Because the notation \\(x_0\\) is used to refer to a number, not the name of an input.\n\n\n It was a mistake.\n\n\n\nquestion id: birch-dig-radio-1\n\n\nHere are the functions for the derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder\nformula for derivative\n\n\n\n\n0th\n\\(\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n1st\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}-x\\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n2nd\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}x^2 - 1\\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n3rd\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}3x - x^3\\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n4th\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}3\\,x^2-x^4     \\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n5th\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}3-6\\,x^3 + x^5     \\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n6th\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}-15\\,x^2 + 10\\,x^4-x^6     \\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n7th\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}-15 + 45\\,x^3-15\\,x^5 + x^7     \\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n8th\n\\(\\left({\\large\\strut}105\\,x^2-105\\,x^4 + 21\\,x^6-x^8     \\right)\\dnorm(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\nWrite a Taylor polynomial function for \\(\\dnorm(x)\\) around \\(x_0=0\\)).

    "text": "Questions for thinking about the relationships.\n\nThis is a set of starter questions about about how \\(V()\\) is related to \\(s\\) and \\(g\\). They are all asked in terms of partial derivatives.\nThe first two, “simple or complicated,” are about whether the sign of the partial derivative w.r.t. a variable changes as that variable changes. If so, there is an extremum. We’ll call that “complicated.” If the partial stays the same sign, that’s a “simple” relationship. “Simple” and “complicated” are not technical terms.\n\nQuestions in terms of derivatives:\n\n\\(\\partial_s V(s, g)\\).\n\nSimple or complicated?\nIf simple, positive or negative, large or small (or zero).\n\nnegative. We go faster with less steepness.\nlarge. The range of steepness corresponds to a factor of roughly 10 in speed.\n\n\n\\(\\partial_g V(s, g)\\)\n\nSimple or complicated?\n\ncomplicated. An increase in gear can either increase or decrease speed. (Too hard a gear kills speed. Too easy a gear thwarts speed. We want a gear that’s just right.)\nIf simple, positive or negative, large or small (or zero).\n\n\n\\(\\partial_{gs} V(s, g)\\) and \\(\\partial_{sg} V(s, g)\\). Note: these are equal at all points where the function \\(V()\\) is smooth.\n\nDoes \\(\\partial_s V(s, g)\\) depend on Gear? - yes.\nEquivalently, does \\(\\partial_g V(s, g)\\) depend on Steepness. - This one is easier to think about. For negative steepness, optimal gear is higher. For positive steepness, optimal gear is lower.\n\n\n\nThis table gives some values for the bike’s velocity as a function of hill steepness and gear.\n\nNote that the optimal gear is at the extremes of \\(g\\) for steep uphill or downhill, and in the middle of \\(g\\) for biking on the flat.\nNote that the speed steadily increases, regardless of \\(g\\) when the steepness becomes more negative.\n\n\n\nSome “data” about \\(V(s, g)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(V(s,g)\\)\n\\(g=1\\)\n\\(g=5\\)\n\\(g=10\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(s=10\\) (uphill)\n2\n1 mph\n0\n\n\n\\(s=0\\) (flat)\n9\n12 mph\n6\n\n\n\\(s=-10\\) (downhill)\n12\n16 mph\n20\n\n\n\n\nSome “data” about \\(\\partial_s V(s,g)\\): it’s negative, everywhere.\nSome “data” about \\(\\partial_g V(s,g)\\): there’s an optimal (maximum speed) gear at each speed. \\(\\partial_g V(s,g)\\) will be zero near the optimum, negative to the right and positive to the left.\n\n\nEmphasize that these are values for the partial derivative of \\(V()\\) with respect to \\(g\\), that is, how the bike speed changes when gear is increased. “Holding everything else constant” means that we can consider the pattern separately for each individual value of \\(s\\). That is, we only have to consider the horizontal pattern in the table in each row separately. When going steeply uphill (\\(s=10\\)), the optimal gear is low (\\(g=1\\)) so increasing the gear will slow the bike. Similarly, when going downhill the optimal gear is hard (\\(g=10\\)) so increasing \\(g\\) from a low value will increase the speed of the bike.

    "text": "A polynomial framework\nOur general purpose tool for constructing local models of functions of two variables is the polynomial.\nWe imagine that there is an output that is a function of two inputs: \\(f(x,y)\\). The polynomial function that we will use will be \\[ f(x,y) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 x y + a_4 x^2 + a_5 y^2\\]\nNote that the six parameters have been subscripted with a number. This is just for convenience in referring to them. You can call them a naught'',a one,’’ ``a two’’, and so on. Whatever the names, each of them is just a scalar.\nDepending on the values of the parameters \\(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\), this function can take on all sorts of shapes. But, in general, not all of the terms are needed.\n\\(a_0\\): The constant term. This sets a typical value of \\(f(x,y)\\), but doesn’t depend on either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). It is almost always included by default.\n\\(a_1 x\\) The linear term in \\(x\\). Produces a simple dependence on the input \\(x\\); if the input \\(x\\) changes, then the output \\(f(x,y)\\) will change.\n\\(a_2 y\\) Likewise, the linear term in \\(y\\). This produces a simple dependence on the input \\(y\\).\n\\(a_4 x^2\\) The quadratic term in \\(x\\) can do two things. It is absolutely needed in the model if there is a maximum or minimum with respect to \\(x\\). But, even if there is no extremum, if there is an important change in \\(\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x}\\) as \\(x\\) changes, then there should be this quadratic term. Example: economists often speak of diminishing marginal returns — doubling the amount of investment doesn’t lead to a doubling in output per dollar of investment.\n\\(a_5 y^2\\) The quadratic term in \\(y\\). Like the quadratic term in \\(x\\), it’s needed for there to be an extremum with respect to \\(y\\), or a change in \\(\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta y}\\).\n\\(a_3 x y\\) The interaction term. This term expresses how the inputs \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) interact: perhaps interfering with one another or reinforcing one another. Whenever the output will depend on \\(x\\) differently for different values of \\(y\\), or vice versa, there should be an interaction term included in the model.\nAlmost always, we include the constant and linear terms in a model, although we might discover that they are not needed if other terms are added. The question is generally whether to include the quadratic and bilinear terms.\n\nNote that the coefficients are named in accordance with the input variables that follow.\n\nBICYCLE: We’ll write the model as\n\\[ V(s,g) = a_0 + a_s s + a_g g + a_{sg} s g + a_{ss} s^2 + a_{gg} g^2\\]\nIn order to decide which of these terms to include in the model \\(v(s,g)\\), it helps to ask the following questions about the two quadratic terms and interaction terms:\n\nIs there an extremum with respect to \\(g\\)? That is, holding \\(s\\) fixed, is there a value of \\(g\\) at which \\(f(s,g)\\) takes on a maximum or minimum value?

    "text": "Positive or negative?\nA good practice when building models is to figure out, based on what we already know, whether the various terms \\(s\\) and \\(g\\) terms will appear positively or negatively. (We don’t have to worry about \\(a_0\\).)\nNow that we’ve thrown out the \\(a_{ss} s^2\\) terms, our model looks like: \\[V(s, g) \\approx a_0 \\pm a_s s \\pm a_g g \\pm a_{gs} gs \\pm a_{gg} g^2\\]\nWe want to assign + or - (or perhaps zero) to each of the four \\(\\pm\\) signs in our model.\n\n\\(a_{gg} g^2\\) needs to be negative. Reason: There is a maximum with respect to \\(g\\) and the second derivative is always negative near a maximum.\n\n\\[V(s,  g) \\approx a_0  \\pm  a_s  s \\pm  a_g g  \\pm a_{gs} gs - a_{gg} g^2\\]\nLets look at \\[\\partial_s V(s,g) = \\pm a_s \\pm a_{gs} g\\]\n\n\\(a_{s} s\\) term needs to be negative. Reason: speed goes down as \\(s\\) grows from zero, holding gear constant.\n\\(a_{gs} g\\) term needs to be negative. If you are in a high gear (suitable for going downhill), \\(V\\) will decrease more sharply as \\(s\\) increases.\n\nLet’s think about \\[\\partial_g V(s,g) = \\pm a_g - a_{gs}s - 2 a_{gg}g.\\] (We already know \\(a_{gg}g^2\\) and \\(a_{gs} sg\\) terms are negative.)\n\n\\(a_g\\) term must be positive, since there are some conditions with \\(s=0\\) (flat) when increasing gear increases speed. (E.g. \\(g\\) is set inappropriately small, so you would go faster in a higher gear. )\n\nPutting this together, we expect that our model will look like:\n\\[V(s,  g) \\approx a_0  -  a_s  s +  a_g g  - a_{gs} gs - a_{gg} g^2\\]\nWe might use this result if we had to assign values to the coefficients without any other info.\nOr, since we have data to fit the model to, we can use our sign expectation to check whether the model (or our reasoning) is making sense.",

The figure of merit would be how long it takes to complete the route. For each segment, compute from the steepness the optimal gear then round that off to the nearest gear number. This gives a velocity for that segment, which can then be turned into time by dividing the length of the segment by the velocity.

    "text": "Labor vs capital\nThe Cobb-Douglas production function is a simple mathematical model of how labor \\(L\\) and capital \\(K\\) combine to produce a factory’s output \\(P\\). It is \\[P(L, K) \\equiv A K^\\alpha L^{1-\\alpha}\\ .\\] For simplicity, imagine that capital and labor are both measured in dollars per year—the amount that the labor force is paid in a year and the amount that one could rent a factory for a year.\n\nIf production \\(P(L, K)\\) is also measured in dollars per year (say, the value of the factory output each year), what is the dimension of the constant \\(A\\)?\nAccording to the model, what happens to production if both \\(K\\) and \\(L\\) are increased by a factor constant factor \\(\\beta\\)? (Hint: Substitute in \\(K \\rightarrow \\beta K\\) and \\(L \\rightarrow \\beta L\\) and simplify.)\nConsider a particular factory with \\(A = 2.5\\) and exponent \\(\\alpha = 0.33\\). In a sandbox, implement the function \\(P (K, L)\\). Use your function to compute the production of the factory for \\(K = 10\\) and \\(L=20\\). Confirm that you get \\(P(K=10,L=20)= 39.78\\)\nA factory that rents for $10/yr and where the labor costs $20/yr is silly. Calculate the value \\(P (K, L)\\) when \\(K\\) is $10 million/yr and \\(L\\) is $20 million/yr.\n\nWe’ll stick with numbers like \\(K = 10\\) and \\(L = 20\\) to keep things easy to read, but feel free to interpret them as “millions of dollars.”\nCongratuations! Based on your ability to use the Cobb-Douglas model, you’ve been promoted to manager of the factory. One of your jobs is to decide how to balance expenditures on capital and labor to raise productivity.\nOne basic question is what happens when you raise either capital or labor, holding the other one constant. Using ap- propriate partial derivatives evaluated at \\(K = 10\\), \\(L = 20\\), calculate:\n\nThe rate at which an increase in spending on labor will increase productivity.\nThe rate at which an increase in spending on capital will increase productivity.\nBased on the above, if you had to choose between spending on capital or labor, and your goal is to increase productivity as much as possible, which would you spend on, capital or labor?\n\nYour economist friend tells you to watch out for “diminishing marginal returns.” This means that, as you increase spending on either labor or capital, the rate of increase in production tends to diminish. You’ll still get increased production as you increase spending, but it won’t increase as fast at high levels of expense as at low levels.\n\nCompute the partial derivative of production with respect to labor at a higher level of labor, say \\(L = 21\\), but holding \\(K = 10\\). How does the value of the derivative at \\(L = 21\\) compare to that at \\(L = 20\\)? Is this consistent with the idea of “diminishing marginal returns” for labor?\nDo the same for the partial derivative of production with respect to capital, evaluated at \\(L = 20\\) and \\(K = 11\\). How does the value of the derivative at \\(K = 11\\) compare to that at \\(K = 10\\). Is this consistent with the idea of “diminishing marginal returns” for capital?\nUse an appropriate partial second derivative to find the rate of diminishing partial returns for labor at \\(L = 20\\) and \\(K = 10\\). Show that it is consistent with the difference you got in Part (d).\nUse an appropriate partial second derivative to find the rate of diminishing partial returns for capital at \\(L = 20\\) and \\(K = 10\\). Show that it is consistent with the difference you got in Part (3).\nYou might think of the rate of increase in production with respect to labor as the “value rate” of labor. Similarly, the rate of increase in production with respect to capital is the value rate of capital. Due to diminishing marginal returns, an increase in labor spending, holding capital constant, decreases the value rate of labor. Similarly, an increase in capital spending holding labor spending constant decreases the value rate of capital.\n\nBut what happens to the value rate of labor when capital spending is increased? You can answer this by comparing the value rate of labor, \\(\\partial_L P\\) , at two different capital spending levels, say \\((K = 10,L = 20)\\) and \\((K = 11,L = 20)\\). Notice that even though you’re looking at the rate with respect to labor, you’re changing the expenditure on capital.\n\nCompare \\(\\partial_L P\\) at slightly different values of \\(K\\) , holding \\(L\\) constant at 20. Does the value rate of labor increase or decrease with spending on capital?\nSimilarly, compare \\(\\partial_K P\\) at slightly different values of \\(L\\), holding \\(K\\) constant at 20. Does the value rate of labor increase or decrease with spending on capital?\nFinally, construct and evaluate the mixed partial derivative, $_L _K P at \\(K = 10\\), \\(L = 20\\). Compare this to the results you got for the way \\(\\partial_K P\\) changes with increasing \\(L\\) and the way \\(\\partial_L P\\) changes with increasing \\(K\\).\n\nBlock-2-models.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Color is not a property of a mathematical vector. Orientation, however, is.\n\n\n\nMeasure the length of each vector. (Hint: Use a ruler! You can round to the nearest millimeter.)\nFind the included angle between the \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}\\) and \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{brown}}\\) vectors. (Your answer should be correct to within \\(\\pm 15^\\circ\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nAbout 135 degrees. Note that the orientation makes a difference. The angle is measured with the vectors placed tail to tail.\n\n\n\nFind the included angle between the \\(\\color{magenta}{\\text{magenta}}\\) and \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}\\) vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nMagenta points in the same direction as brown, so the answer is the same as in the previous question.\n\n\n\nFind the included angle between 0.7 times the \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}\\) vector and -11.3 times the \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{brown}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe scaling does not matter except that the negative sign for the brown vector means that its orientation will be reversed. This means that the included angle will be 45 degrees, not 135 degrees as in the previous two questions.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Suppose \\[\\vec{\\mathbf u} \\equiv  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}4\\\\-3\\end{array}\\right)  \\  \\  \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\vec{\\mathbf v} \\equiv  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\2\\end{array}\\right)\\ .\\] The following questions ask you to compute the length of the vector given.

The concrete block is an “acoustic mirror.” Its purpose is to collect and reflect sound from an aircraft, concentrating them at a point where they can be picked up by a microphone. Moving the microphone to a point where the concentrated sound is strongest allows the aircraft’s bearing to be identified, helping observers acquire the aircraft visually.\n\nSource\nFigure 2 shows how, with two or more such acoustic mirrors, the location of the aircraft can be identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nGive the position of the aircraft as a multiple of \\(\\vec{a}\\) from sound mirror A and as a multiple of \\(\\vec{b}\\) from sound mirror B.

Hold a pencil perpendicular to the paper with the eraser on the dot. Now, (using a pen!) draw a vector on the paper that is perpendicular to the pencil. Now draw 5 more vectors, each different from the other, that are all perpendicular to the pencil.\nDraw a vector \\(\\vec{c}\\) on the paper. Now draw another vector on the paper that is perpendicular to the first. Label it \\(\\vec{a}\\). Find another vector, to be labeled \\(\\vec{b}\\) that lies on the paper, is orthogonal to \\(\\vec{c}\\), and has a different direction from \\(\\vec{a}\\). It will turn out that \\(\\vec{a} = k \\vec{b}\\). Write down the numerical value of the scalar \\(k\\) for your \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\).\nConsider the vector \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (2, 5)^T\\). Using only arithmetic, find some other vector \\(\\vec{z}\\) that is perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w}\\). (Hint: To be perpendicular, \\(\\vec{z}^T \\cdot \\vec{w}\\) must be zero. So make up two numbers such \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(2 a + 5 b  = 0\\).) Write \\(\\vec{z}\\) on your paper.\nRepeat (c) and create another vector \\(\\vec{z}_2\\) that is different from \\(\\vec{z}\\). Write \\(\\vec{z}_2\\) on your paper. In addition, find the scalar \\(k\\) such that \\(\\vec{z}_2 = k \\vec{z}\\).\n\nIn the following exercises, you are asked to find numerical vectors that are perpendicular (“orthogonal”) to the stated vector. This is equivalent to finding a new vector whose dot product with the stated vector is zero. (Except … the new vector cannot be all zeros! The all-zero vector is exceptional and has no direction.) One effective strategy is to write down a vector consisting of a 1 in any position you like and zeros elsewhere. Find the dot product, calling it \\(d\\). Then select one of the zeros to turn it non-zero. What value should it have? Just enough so that when included in the dot product it contributes \\(-d\\).\n\nConsider the vector \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (1,  2,  -3, 2)^T\\).\n\nFind a vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) that is perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w}\\).\nFind another vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) that is perpendicular both to \\(\\vec{w}\\) and to \\(\\vec{a}\\). (Hint: It can be done.)\nCreate yet another vector \\(\\vec{c}\\) that is a linear combination of \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\). (You can choose whatever combination you like, but both coefficients should be non-zero.) What is the angle between \\(\\vec{c}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\)?\n\nYou have been sent on a mission to 5-dimensional space. Your task is to find a vector that is perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (2,1,3,3,-4)^T\\). Do so.\nBONUS. Find as many vectors as you can that are perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (2,1,3,3,-4)^T\\) and to each other. The arithmetic will not necessarily be easy. When you give up (with honor!), figure out how many mutually perpendicular vectors there can be in 5-dimensional space. How about 10-dimensional space?\n\n\n\nExercise 8 In physics and engineering, there is a very important operation called the cross product and written \\(\\vec{u}\\times\\vec{v}\\). The operation is only defined for vectors in 3-dimensional space. The output of the cross product is another 3-dimensional vector which can be calculated arithmetically as:\n\\[\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a\\\\b\\\\c\\end{array}\\right) \\times \\left(\\begin{array}{c}e\\\\f\\\\g\\end{array}\\right) \\equiv\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}b\\, g - c\\, f\\\\c\\, e - a\\, g\\\\a\\, f - b\\, e\\end{array}\\right)\\]\nMake up coordinates for two three-dimensional vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\) that point in different directions.\nCalculate the cross product \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv \\vec{u} \\times \\vec{v}\\).\n\nFind the angle between \\(\\vec{w}\\) and \\(\\vec{u}\\).\nFind the angle between \\(\\vec{w}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n\nOther than this brief description, we will not use cross products at all in this course. But keep them in mind for your upcoming physics and engineering courses.\n\n30-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Being a point, the target has a definite location relative to the coordinate axes.\n“Solving” this sort of system amounts to finding a linear combination of the two vectors whose result is a vector that can connect the origin to the target. (We call this a target problem.)\n\nCopy over each diagram to your paper. (Any reasonable approximation will do.) Then, for each diagram, find the linear combination of the two vectors that will reach from the origin to the target. Show your work, meaning that you should draw the scaled vectors in a proper position that demonstrates that they do indeed connect the origin to the target. Underneath the diagram, write down the numerical value of the scalars in the linear combination. (Again, any reasonable approximation will do.)\n\n31-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

    "text": "Expected Social Security\n\\[\n\\newcommand{\\dnorm}{\\text{dnorm}}\n\\newcommand{\\pnorm}{\\text{pnorm}}\n\\newcommand{\\recip}{\\text{recip}}\n\\]\nIn this project, we’re going to study some statistics of life and death. Specifically, we’re going to look at “period life tables” assembled and published by the US Social Security Administration.\nThe M2014F data frame is basic data from 2014 on age-specific mortality, that is, the risk of a person of any given age having died in 2014. The table below is for females; there is a similar table for males on the Social Security website.\nScroll through the data until you are comfortable with the format. The variables year and age are self explanatory. pmort is the probability of a person of the given age having died in the next year. nliving and died are not counts from the population but a construction of a theoretical cohort of 100,000 newborn people whose lives are such as to follow, at any age, the mortality at that age. Thus, given the age-specific mortality in 2014, of the theoretical 100,000 newborns, 99,342 would still be alive at the end of age 10. died is the number from the theoretical cohort who would have died during the given the value number who are still alive at any age. While not exact basically nliving - died within an age will output nliving for the following age.\nEssay 1: For the following essay question ensure that your answer is in the form of complete sentences and utilizes proper grammar.Explain why in the first row nliving + ndead does not add up to 100,000. Additionally, explain why nliving in row 4 is equal to 99,412 (In other words, how was the number calculated).\nActive R chunk 1 makes a plot of the mortality rate as a function of age. By default, the plot is being made with semi-log axes, but you can change the code to make the plot on linear axes or on log-log axes.\nThe pattern of mortality vs age has a complex shape that becomes simpler if we split the domain into a handful of epochs. Use the various kinds of axes scaling to answer each of these questions.\nWe’re going to work with people who have an interest in eventual retirement, either saving for it or drawing from their savings. We could make a cubic spline function that fits the data, but the data are already very smooth and even a straight-line interpolant would be adequate. Instead, we will employ an easy to use method that models log mortality versus age using a small set of basis functions, shown in the following graph:\nSimplifying a little, Social Security works like this: All workers have a payroll tax that is considered their “contribution” to the Social Security fund. At retirement (currently age 67) and until death, the worker receives a monthly stipend off approximately $2000.\nOur goal is to calculate the net present value of this stipend stream from the point of view of a 67-year old. Here are the components of the calculation:\n(1) and (2) are easy. At age \\(y\\), the stipend stream is worth \\[ s(y) = 24000 \\times e^{0.02(y-67)}\\]\n(3) requires a bit more work. We’ll focus on the number of people (in the hypothetical population) still living. Here’s the data, along with a not-very-good function approximating the data. The method used to construct the model, logistic regression, is not one you have seen before. We’ll use it here, treating it as a black box. You don’t need to worry about how it works other than to know it constructs an appropriately shaped function from data.\n# Construct a model of the probability\n# by a special technique called \"logistic regression\"\nprob_living &lt;- makeFun(\n  glm(nliving/100000 ~ age, data = M2014F, \n      family = binomial)\n)\n\nWarning in eval(family$initialize): non-integer #successes in a binomial glm!\n\ngf_point(nliving/100000 ~ age, data = M2014F) |&gt;\n  slice_plot(prob_living(age) ~ age, color=\"blue\") |&gt;\n  gf_labs(y=\"Prob. of living until age\")\nred        orange        black        blue       \n\nquestion id: retirement-6\nThe function fitted to the data is not very good. You’re going to make it better using the same technique we used with the mortality vs age data. Specifically, instead of the tilde expression nliving/100000 ~ age, you will use nliving/100000 ~ ns(age,??), where the ?? must be replaced with a small integer saying how many basis functions to use. Start with 2 and increase gradually until the graph of the function goes right through the data points. Only change the first tilde function inside the makeFun function not both.\n3        5        12        19       \n\nquestion id: ISJ1As\nImportant technical note: We are providing you with our own prob_living() function in order to play well with the other software in this document. It’s the same function mathematically as the one you created in the sandbox (using the correct answer to the previous question).\nThe function prob_living() is our model of someone living to a given age, but who is that person. The way prob_living() is written, that person is someone just born. But, insofar as we are interested in the present value of Social Security payments made to a person who starts at age 67, we have to take it for granted that this person is still alive. So the probablity that a (relevant) person is alive at 67 is 100%. We need to modify prob_living() to take this into account. This is easy; just divide prob_living() by its numerical value at age 67. That will make the overall output 100% at age 67.\n0.7291\n\n\n 0.8143\n\n\n 0.8574\n\n\n 0.9105\n\n\n\nquestion id: retirement-8\nNow we can put together all the components we need for component (3) as described above: the present value of the instantaneous average Social Security payment to a person of age \\(y\\).\n24000 * exp(0.02*(y-67)) * prob_living(y)/0.8574\nUsing R, implement this function, and accumulate it from age 67 to age 100. Hint: When you see the word accumulate regarding a continuous function, you should immediately think integrate.\n$480,000        $580,000        $780,000        $980,000       \n\nquestion id: retirement-9\nBefore you do a complicated calculation, you should have in mind what the answer will be so that you can make sure the result of your calculation is reasonable. You may well ask, “How am I supposed to know the result before I do the calculation itself?” The answer: you should have a simple technique to get a ballpark estimate for the answer.\nIn this situation, you might do the following:\nEssay 2: For the following essay question ensure that your answer is in the form of complete sentences and utilizes proper grammar.A classmate runs their model and finds the answer to be $1,121,751. Your classmate did a reasonable calculation, but has failed to account for something. What did they forget to account for? Hint: use the sandbox above removing aspects of the equation to find what was neglected. Your answer should explain in everyday words what is missing (not the mathematical portion of the equation that is missing).",

At 2% per year, it takes about 36 years for the 2% discount to cut the value by half, and not so many people live to be 67 + 36.\nInstead of using a probability of being alive at any age, just make a good estimate of how long a typical 67-year old lives. You can make such an estimate simply from the graph of prob_living() shown above. Let’s say the estimate is 18 years.\nMultiply the yearly payment by the number of years of life, so $24,000 \\(\\times 18 =\\) $432,000.",

    "text": "Life expectancy\nYou now have most of the apparatus to calculate one of the most commonly used indices of public health and yet one highly mis-understood by most decision makers: Life expectancy.\nFirst, you need the model of the probability of dying at any exact given age. Then, calculate the **expectation value* of age according to this probability model.\nWe already have a probability of survival as a function of age: prob_living(). At first it might seem to you that the probability of dying at age \\(y\\) is 1 - prob_living(y) (in otherwords the opposite of probability of dying at any exact age in the opposite of probability of survival), but that’s not true. Why not? Because 1 - prob_living(y) is a probability of dying at age \\(y\\) or before. That is, it is the accumulated probability across all people.\nWe need to “de-accumulate” the probability, to get to the change in probability from one year to the next. Let’s replace the word “accumulation” with its calculus synonym: anti-derivative. We we need to “de-anti-derivative” the 1 - prob_living(y) function. That is, it’s the derivative of 1 - prob_living(y) that we want.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nModify the R statements to compute the expectation value of age. Recall that an expectation value of a quantity \\(y\\) is \\(\\int y\\, p(y) dy\\) over the relevant domain.\n\nAccording to our model prob_living(), what’s the expectation value of age (that is, “life expectancy” for females born in 2014)?\n\n\n 81        83        87        89       \n\nquestion id: retirement-10\n\n\nPossibly you didn’t follow the (brief) argument about why to use the derivative of 1 - prob_living(y) instead of just 1 - prob_living(y) itself. So let’s try it out and see what we get:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nDoes that seem reasonable based upon your experience?

    "text": "Misunderstanding life expectancy\nWhat’s there to mis-understand about life expectancy? I’m not referring to the calculation itself, which puts together some challenging concepts like differentiation, integration, and function fitting.\nThe fundamental mistake is to use the short form of the name, “life expectancy” rather than the full name, “life expectancy at age ___.” The number you hear about is “life expectancy at birth.”\nPeople use life expectancy at birth to make decisions about things for which it is misleading. For instance, in public debates about health care, you will often hear that other rich nations have longer life expectancy than the US even though they spend half as much money per capita on health care. But the low US life expectancy is shaped largely by some features not so relevant to health care: the relatively high infant mortality in the US (which has it’s own set of factors), the high teenager mortality (which is not as clear when only looking at the data for females), gun deaths, etc.\nSince the large majority of health-care spending is for seniors, we should look at the outcome for seniors. For instance, we might want to look at life expectancy at age 67. Let’s calculate that. Note that the calculation is the same as the above, but prob_living(y) has been adjusted so that it applies to people who reach age 67.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nEssay 3: For the following essay, ensure that your answer is in the form of complete sentences and utilizes proper grammar. The immediately above calculation found life expectancy to be 85.8346. This number is larger than the life expectancy that was calculated in the previous section (81.04189). Why is that? Be sure to explain what both numbers are in your response.”\n\nBlock-3-models.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",
