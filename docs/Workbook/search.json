As you know, cardboard boxes have four sides as well as eight flaps, four for the top and four for the bottom. The flaps are arranged to provide double coverage; you fold the flaps from one direction and then fold over them the flaps from the other direction.\n\n The diagram depicts the box sides and flaps laid out on a flat piece of cardboard. The flaps are shaded with diagonal lines. The formulas give the areas of various rectangles on the sheet.\n\nSuppose the height, width, and depth of the box are \\(h\\), \\(w\\), and \\(d\\) respectively. The box volume is easy:\n\\[V = h w d\\] The area of cardboard consists of the the four sides and the eight flaps. Each component’s area is a product of the two edge lengths. For example, the box sides are either \\(w h\\) or \\(d h\\). The flaps, each of which extends half-way across the bottom or top have areas \\(w d/2\\).\n\nWhich of these formulas gives the area of the cardboard making up the box?\n\n\n\n \\(2 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(4 h(w + d) + 2 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 h(w + d) + 8 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(4 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-1\n\n\nA common size for a box is 1.3 cubic feet. We will use feet as the units for \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\).\n\nThe following formulas do not describe the area of the cardboard, but they are nonetheless formulas for something. Except one of them, which cannot be true. Which one?\n\n\n\n \\(h(w + d)/d + w d^2/h\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w + d) + w h d\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w + d) + w^2 h/d\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w^2/d + d) + d^2\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-2\n\n\nAs \\(w\\), \\(h\\), or \\(d\\) are changed, the volume and surface area of the box are changed. Asking for the \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\) that minimize the surface area of the box is not a complete statement of a problem. The minimum surface area will be zero whenever two of the three dimensions have length zero. In other words, we can minimize the surface area by making a box that is no box at all!\nTo complete the problem statement we need something else. Here, that something is a constraint: We demand that the box have a volume of \\(V = 1.3\\) cubic feet.\nOften, a constraint plays the role of a dimension reduction. With \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\), we have a 3-input optimization problem. But we can use the constraint equation to solve for one of the quantities as a function of the others and the (known) volume. For instance, we can find \\(h\\) as \\[h = V/d w\\]\n\nPlug in the above expression for \\(h\\) into the formula for the surface area of cardboard. Which of the following is the resulting formula in terms of \\(w\\), \\(d\\), and \\(V\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(2 V(w + d)/wd + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(V(w + d)/w + V(w+d)/d  + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 w d (w + d)/V + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 (w + d)/wd + 4 V w d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-3\n\n\nActive R chunk 1 contains the formula for the surface area \\(A(w, d, V)\\) of a box of volume \\(V\\). The graphics command draw a contour plot of \\(A()\\) as a function of \\(w\\) and \\(d\\), holding \\(V = 1.3\\) cubic feet.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n:::\n\nWhen you draw the contour plot, you will see a broad area near the center inside the contour at area = 9.5. Towards the upper-right and lower-left corners of the plot frame are contours at higher levels of area.\n\n4. The spacing between the contours in the corners is tight, but there is no similarly spaced contour inside the region delimited by the contour at area=9.5.

You can do this by replacing the argument `contours_at = NULL` with this:\n\n```r\ncontours_at = c(10, 9.5, 9.4))\nAdd more contours to build a fence tighter and tighter around the argmin. When the fenced region is tiny, you can read off the min from the contour label. (Remember, the “argmin” is the value of the inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) at which the function is minimized. The “min” is the value of the function at the argmin.) But watch out as you do this. If you ask for a contour at a level that is lower than the min, it will simply not be drawn. Or, more precisely, there are no inputs that produce an output that is lower than the min. So you may have to change the interval between levels (e.g. 10, 9.5, 9.4, …) to home in on the argmin.\n\nThe following are values for the output of the function where you might be able to draw a contour. Which one of the values is the smallest for which a contour appears?\n\n\n 9.1        9.05        9.01        9.005        9.0005        9       \n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-5\n\n\n\nFrom your contour plot, read off the values of \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) that produce the minimum surface area for a 1.3 cubic-foot box. What are they? (Hint: You may need to zoom in on the domain to get the precision needed to answer the question.)\n\n\n \\(w \\approx 0.9; d\\approx 0.9\\)        \\(w \\approx 0.9; d\\approx 0.6\\)        \\(w \\approx 0.5; d\\approx 0.9\\)        \\(w \\approx 1.9; d\\approx 0.9\\)       \n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-6\n\n\nIt is easy enough for a person to look at a contour plot and roughly locate the argmin. But this is not feasible if there are more than two inputs to the function being optimized. For such functions, another set of numerical techniques are used based on the gradient of the objective function. Remember that the gradient at any point is a vector that points in the uphill direction and whose length is proportional to the steepness of the slope. (Skiers, beware. In skiing what people call the gradient is the steepest downhill direction. This might account for all the mathematicians learning to ski who point their skis uphill in response to the ski instructor’s instruction!)\nYou can display the gradient on the plot of the area function by piping (remember |&gt;) the contour plot into the commented-out command in the sandbox. (Also, replace #pipe to with |&gt;.)\n\nSince the end of the term is coming, here is a question that might be a good review for the final. Which of these describes the relationship between the gradient vector and the contours?\n\n\n\n On a contour the gradient vector is perpendicular (“orthogonal”) to the contour.\n\n\n On a contour, the gradient vector has zero length.\n\n\n There is no definite relationship; it depends on the function itself.\n\n\n On a contour, the gradient vector has a length proportional to the contour level.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-7\n\n\n\nWhich of these best describes the gradient vector at the argmin?\n\n\n\n The gradient points due North.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is maximal.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is minimal.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is zero.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-8\n\n\nMany numerical optimization techniques are based on the idea like this: treating the field of gradient vectors as a flow field in a differential equation. Starting at some initial value, follow the gradient vectors (as you did in sketching the trajectory in a flow field). If seeking a maximum, the flow will be in the direction of the gradient. If seeking a minimum, the flow will be opposite the direction of the gradient. It is not necessary to calculate the gradient everywhere; you just have to calculate it at the present point on your trajectory to know which way to go next.\nOccasionally, particularly in textbook problems, the argmin or argmax is found algebraically. This still involves calculating the gradient as a function of the inputs. Then, find the inputs that make all the components of the gradient vector zero.\n\nWhich of these formulas give the gradient vector of \\(A(w, d)\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 w\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2} - 4 w\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 d\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w} - 4 d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-9\n\n\n\nIf the lengths \\(w\\), \\(d\\), \\(h\\) are measured in feet, what unit will \\(\\partial_w A\\) be in?\n\n\n feet        square feet        cubic feet        1/feet        dimensionless       \n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-10\n\n\nFor those of you who are pining for algebra problems, here you go.\nTaking the gradient of \\(A(w, d)\\) (given in a previous question), set both components to zero, giving you two equations in the two variables \\(w\\) and \\(d\\). There is also a \\(V\\) in the equations, but we’ve set up the problem saying that we already know \\(V\\). Numerically, we used \\(V=1.3\\) cubic-feet, but in the algebra solution we can just leave \\(V\\) as a symbol, giving general formulas for \\(w\\) and for \\(d\\) in terms of \\(V\\).\n\nWhich of these is the correct formula for the optimal \\(w^\\star\\) as a function of \\(V\\)? (Hint: You can weed out one of the choices by checking for dimensional consistency.)\n\n\n\n \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{V}}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\)\n\n\n \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{V}}{\\sqrt[3]{3}}\\)\n\n\n \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[2]{V}}{\\sqrt[2]{3}}\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-11\n\n\nThe solution for \\(d^\\star\\) is the same as for \\(w^\\star\\). (An experienced algebraist would have noticed that in the formula for area, you can swap inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) without changing the output.)\nNow compute the formula for the optimal value \\(h^\\star\\). (Hint: Early in the section we gave a formula that involves \\(V\\), \\(h\\), \\(w\\), and \\(d\\).)\n\nWhich of these is the correct formula for the optimal \\(h^\\star\\) as a function of \\(V\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(h^\\star = 2^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n \\(h^\\star =  2^{1/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n \\(h^\\star =  3^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n \\(h^\\star =  3^{1/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-12\n\n\nIt turns out that \\(h^\\star\\) is somewhat larger than either \\(w^\\star\\) or \\(d^\\star\\); the optimal box has a square top and bottom, but the sides are not square.\n\nWhich of these is an appropriate explanation for why \\(h^\\star\\) is larger than \\(w^\\star\\) or \\(d^\\star\\)?\n\n\n\n People don’t like using boxes that are perfect cubes.\n\n\n \\(h\\) multiplies both \\(w\\) and \\(d\\), but not vice versa, in the formula for surface area.\n\n\n The flaps need to get longer as \\(h\\) gets longer, so smaller \\(h\\) helps to minimize the amount of cardboard.\n\n\n The flap-length does not depend on \\(h\\), only on \\(w d\\). So we can make \\(h\\) larger without contributing to the “wasted” area of the doubling over of flaps. The flaps get smaller as \\(wd\\) gets smaller, so larger \\(h\\) is preferred.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 If you’re skeptical that a dog might do a calculus problem (as in Exercise 3) before running to fetch a ball, consider the path taken by a photon. “Fermat’s Principle” is that light takes the path of least time. To illustrate, consider the problem of a photon traveling from a point A to a point B, as in the diagram. The shortest path between the two points is a straight line. Along this straight-line path, the time taken by the photon will be the distance divided by the speed of light.\nThe diagram shows another path consisting of two segments, one of length \\(l_1\\) and the other \\(l_2\\). Obviously, the two-segment path is longer than the straight-line path. But according to Fermat’s principle, light “prefers” the longer path if the time taken to traverse it is shorter. This phenomenon is called refraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Refraction of light on the path from A to B through a change in medium.\n\n\n\nThe reason the indirect path might be shorter is that the speed of light differs in different physical media. Light traveling in a vacuum famously has a speed of about 300,000 km per second. In air, the speed is smaller by a factor of 1/1.003. In water, the speed is smaller still: the factor is 1/1.3.\nImagine that the blue zone of the diagram is water and the clear zone air. The time for the photon to travel from point A to B is proportional to \\(1.003\\ l_1 + 1.3\\ l_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nTo see the path taken by light, let’s imagine that point A is \\((x=0, y=10)\\) and point B is \\((x=20, y=-10)\\), and that the boundary between water and air is at \\(y=0\\). We will place the point P at \\((x, 0)\\). The total time taken for light to traverse this path is 1.003 dist(A to P) + 1.3 dist(P to B).\n\nWhich of these formulas gives the total time it takes for light to traverse the path from A to P at relative speed 1/1.003 and then the path from P to B at relative speed 1/1.3? A is located at \\((0, 10)\\), B is located at \\((20,-10)\\), and P is located at \\((x, 0)\\)\n\n\n\n \\(1.003 \\sqrt{(x-0)^2 +(0-10)^2}+ 1.3\\sqrt{(20-x)^2 + (-10 - 0)^2}\\)\n\n\n \\(\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 +(0-10)^2}/1.003+ \\sqrt{(20-x)^2 + (-10 - 0)^2}/1.3\\)\n\n\n \\(1.003 \\sqrt{(x-10)^2 +(0-0)^2}+ 1.3\\sqrt{(-10 -x)^2 + (50 - 0)^2}\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: optim-pink-1\n\n\nImplement the calculation of total_time() in Active R chunk 2, then use a graph to find the argmin.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nWhat value of \\(x\\) (that is, the argmin) minimizes the travel time of light between points A and B?

You throw a ball down the beach, but at an angle so it lands in the water. Swimmer goes to work. She runs down the beach (fast) and then plunges into the water, heading toward the ball. She can run fast on the beach: 400 m/minute. But she swims rather slower: 50 m/min.\nSuppose you threw the ball to a point about 50 meters down the beach and 10 meters out in the water. The overall distance to the ball is therefore \\(\\sqrt{50^2 + 10^2} \\approx 51\\) meters. If Swimmer entered the water immediately, she would take about a minute to reach the ball (51 m / 50 m/min). Swimmer can get to the ball faster by running down the beach a bit and then turning into the water. If Swimmer ran all 50 meters down the beach and then turned to swim the 10 meters, it would take her (50/400 + 10/50) minutes, about one-third of a minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Swimmer’s optimal path to the ball consists of running \\(x\\) meters along the shore, then swimming diagonally to the ball.\n\n\n\nCan Swimmer do better? You can set up the calculation like this. Imagine \\(x\\) to be the distance down the beach that Swimmer runs. The time to run this distance will be \\(x/400\\). The distance remaining to the ball can be found by the Pythagorean theorem. One leg of the triangle has length \\((50-x)\\), the other has length 10 m. So, the length of the third side is \\(\\sqrt{\\strut (50-x)^2 + 10^2}\\). For instance, if \\(x\\) were 45, the distance to swim in the water would be \\(\\sqrt{(50-45)^2 + 10^2} = 11.2\\) m. Divide this distance by 50 m/min to get the time spent in the water.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 3\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nTime_to_ball() takes one argument, the distance \\(x\\) Swimmer runs down the beach before turning into the water. Complete and use Active R chunk 3 to find the distance that calculus-savvy Swimmer runs down the beach before turning into the water, if Swimmer’s goal is to get to the ball as fast as possible.\nWhat’s the optimal running distance for Swimmer?\n\n 46.75        47.5        48.75        49.75       \n\nquestion id: optim-violet-1\n\n\nHere’s a news story about a mathematician’s dog on the shore of Lake Michigan. It is not plausible that Swimmer has been trained in calculus. Perhaps the way Swimmer solves the running distance problem is simply to graph time_to_ball(x) ~ x over a suitable domain and find the argmax by eye!\n\n\nExercise 4  \n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFigure 1 shows a lens together with a source and target point. Light passing through the lens is refracted. The path followed by the light will be the one with the shortest time of transit from source to target.\nThe light enters the lens at some point \\(P_{in} = (x_{in}\\ , \\ -\\text{Lens}(x_{in}))\\) and leaves at \\(P_{out} = (x_{out}\\ ,\\  \\text{Lens}(x_{out}))\\). We don’t know either \\(x_{in}\\) or \\(x_{out}\\). but we can find them by optimization.\nTo do this, we find the distance from the source to \\(P_{in}\\), and from \\(P_{out}\\) to the target. These two legs of the route are through air, so the time of transit on each leg is proportional to the refractive index 1.03 times the distance.\nOf course, light also has to travel through the lens. We will make the lens out of glass with a high refractive index, so the transit time will be the distance from \\(P_{in}\\) to \\(P_{out}\\) multiplied by the lens’s refractive index of 1.8.\nThe objective function will be the sum of the three legs’ transit times. It is already programmed for you in the sandbox. So is the command to make a contour plot of the output of the objective function over a domain of \\(x_{in}\\) and \\(x_{out}\\). Finally, the last line in ?lst-optim-purpose draws a picture of the lens and the light path, but you will have to insert the argmins \\(x_{in}\\) and \\(x_{out}\\) that you pick from the contour plot of the objective function. (The \\(x_{in}\\) and \\(x_{out}\\) shown in the initial code of Active R chunk 4 are not right!)\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 4\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nNote: The plot_lens() function is provided for you, but it’s too computer-ese to bother you with how it’s defined.\n\nWhen the index of refraction of the lens is 1.80, what are the optimal values for \\(x_{in}\\) and \\(x_{out}\\)?

A simple situation is when there is no lens at all. One way to do this is to change the middle line of transit_time() so that the index of refraction is 1.03, just like the surrounding air.\n\nWhen the index of refraction of the lens is 1.03, what are the optimal values for \\(x_{in}\\) and \\(x_{out}\\)? (Choose the best answer.)\n\n\n\n \\(x_{in} = -17, \\ x_{out} = -15\\)\n\n\n \\(x_{in} = -18, \\ x_{out} = -14\\)\n\n\n \\(x_{in} = -16, \\ x_{out} = -16\\)\n\n\n \\(x_{in} = -18, \\ x_{out} = -18\\)\n\n\n \\(x_{in} = -17, \\ x_{out} = -18\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: optim-purple-2\n\n\nLet’s explore an extreme situation. Diamond is the transparent material that has the highest index of refraction, 2.417. Imagine a material with an index of refraction of 10. This means that light will travel very slowly within the lens.\nWhen you examine the contour plot of transit_time() for this high index of refraction, there will be two, widely separated local minima. Explain briefly which part of the lens these two minima correspond to. Hint: High index means slow speed of light.

For instance, in selecting cadets for pilot training, two obvious criteria are the cadet’s demonstrated flying aptitude and the leadership potential of the cadet. Let’s assume that the merit \\(M\\) of a candidate is a function of flying aptitude \\(F\\) and leadership potential \\(L\\).\nCurrently, the merit score is a simple function of the \\(F\\) and \\(L\\) scores: \\[M_{current}(F, L) \\equiv F + L\\]\nThe general in charge of the training program is not satisfied with the current merit function. “I’m getting too many cadets who are great leaders but poor pilots, and too many pilot hot-shots who are poor leaders. I would rather have an good pilot who is a good leader than have a great pilot who is a poor leader or a poor pilot who is a great leader.” (You might reasonably agree or disagree with this point of view, but the general is in charge.)\nYou’ve been tasked to develop an improved formula for the merit score \\(M_{improved}(F, L)\\).\nA low-order polynomial model, without quadratic terms, is \\[M(F, L) = d_0 + d_1 F + d_2 L + d_{12} F L .\\]\nYou are trying to decide whether \\(d_{12}\\) should be positive, negative, or zero. To guide your decision, you have only this statement from the general in charge of the program: ”\nTake a few minutes now to think about how you would decide whether \\(d_{12}\\) should be positive or negative or zero to implement the general’s view. The rest of the problem will guide you to a solution, but you will understand better if you try on your own, first.\nUsing the low-order polynomial model, find algebraically these two partial derivatives\n\n\\(\\partial_F M(F, L)\\) and\n\\(\\partial_L M(F, L)\\)\n\n\nWhich of these possibilities is true about \\(\\partial_F M\\) as a function of \\(F\\)?\n\n\n Increases with F        Decreases with F        Is not a function of F.       \n\nquestion id: rooster-red-1\n\n\n\nWhich of these possibilities is true about \\(\\partial_L M\\) as a function of \\(L\\)?\n\n\n Increasing        Decreasing        Is not a function of L.       \n\nquestion id: rooster-red-2\n\n\n\nWhich one of these describes the relationship between \\(\\partial_F M()\\) as a function of \\(L\\) and \\(\\partial_L M()\\) as a function of \\(F\\)? (Hint: Remember that \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) are specified as being positive.)\n\n\n\n If \\(\\partial_F M()\\) is an increasing function of \\(L\\), then \\(\\partial_L M()\\) must be a decreasing function of \\(F\\).\n\n\n If \\(\\partial_F M()\\) is an increasing function of \\(L\\), then \\(\\partial_L M()\\) must be an increasing function of \\(F\\).\n\n\n Neither of the above needs to be true.\n\n\n\nquestion id: rooster-red-3\n\n\nThink now about the general’s statement and how to translate it into mathematical terms. Here’s a hint: Imagine Drew has very high \\(F\\) score and low \\(L\\) score. Consider another cadet, Blake, with scores \\(F-\\epsilon\\) and \\(L + \\epsilon\\). Blake’s flying and leadership scores are closer together than Drew’s. Both Drew and Blake have the same average of \\(F\\) and \\(L\\). But would the general find Blake superior or inferior to Drew? If superior, then you would want \\(\\partial_L M &gt; \\partial_F M\\). If inferior, then your model should have \\(\\partial_L M &lt; \\partial_F M\\). If the general would be indifferent between Drew and Blake, then the two partial derivatives should be equal.\n\nBased on the general’s statement, do you want \\(d_{12}\\) to be positive, negative, or zero?\n\n\n\n Positive\n\n\n Zero\n\n\n Negative\n\n\n It has nothing to do with the general’s statement.\n\n\n\nquestion id: rooster-red-4\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7 Based on an extensive but fictive observation of activity and grades of college students, the model shown in Figure 4 was constructed to give GPA as a function of the number of hours each weekday (Monday-Friday) spent studying and spent in social activity and play.

There are many ways to perform the work to extract the argmax once the objective function and constraints are set.\nUnderstandably, calculus textbooks tend to emphasize techniques based on finding an input where the derivative of the objective function is zero. For problems involving multiple inputs, the task is to find an input where the gradient vector is zero.\nContemporary work often involves problems with tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of inputs. Even in such large problems, the mechanics of finding the corresponding gradient vector are straightforward. Searching through a high-dimensional space, however, is not generally a task that can be accomplished using calculus tools. Instead, starting in the 1940s, great creativity has been applied to develop algorithms with names like linear programming, quadratic programming, dynamic programming, etc. many of which are based on ideas from linear algebra such as the qr.solve() algorithm for solving the target problem, or ideas from statistics and statistical physics that incorporate randomness as an essential component. An entire field, operations research, focuses on setting up and solving such problems. Building appropriate algorithms requires deep understanding of several areas of mathematics. But using the methods is mainly a matter of knowing how to set up the problem and communicate the objective function, constraints, etc. to a computer.\nPurely as an example, let’s examine the operation of an early algorithmic optimization method: Nelder-Mead, dating from the mid-1960s. (There are better, faster methods now, but they are harder to understand.)\nNelder-Mead is designed to search for maxima of objective functions with \\(n\\) inputs. The video shows an example with \\(n=2\\) in the domain of a contour plot of the objective function. Of course, you can simply scan the contour plot by eye to find the maxima and minima. The point here is to demonstrate the Nelder-Mead algorithm.\nStart by selecting \\(n+1\\) points on the domain that are not colinear. When \\(n=2\\), the \\(2+1\\) points are the vertices of a triangle. The set of points defines a simplex, which you can think of as a region of the domain that can be fenced off by connecting the vertices.\nEvaluate the objective function at the vertices of the simplex. One of the vertices will have the lowest score for the output of the objective. From that vertex, project a line through the midpoint of the fence segment defined by the other \\(n\\) vertices. In the video, this is drawn using dashes. Then try a handful of points along that line, indicated by the colored dots in the video. One of these will have a higher score for the objective function than the vertex used to define the line. Replace that vertex with the new, higher-scoring point. Now you have another simplex and can repeat the process. The actual algorithm has additional rules to handle special cases, but the gist of the algorithm is simple.\n\n\n\n24-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

We use the following conventions, some of which may be obvious and others not so much.\n\n\\(f()\\) — Function itself. Since there is only one input it does not matter what the name is.\n\\(f(x)\\) — Function itself. \\(x\\) is the name of an input, not the specific value an input.\n\\(f(2)\\) — The value of the output when \\(f()\\) is applied to the input value 2.\n\\(f(x)\\left.{\\Large\\strut}\\right|_{x=2}\\). This distinct vertical bar notation means, take the function \\(f(x)\\) and evaluate it at input value 2.\n\\(f(x=2)\\) — Same thing as (d).\n\nThese conventions don’t tell us how to read expressions involving \\(\\partial_x\\) or \\(\\partial_t\\), etc.\nTo avoid ambiguity we need to stipulate the meaning of different notation forms. We will frame this as a question of “operator precedence” of the same sort used in interpreting an expression like \\(3 x^2\\) as meaning \\(3 \\left(x^2\\right)\\).\n\nWhen the prime notation is used, as in \\(f'(2)\\), the prime has precedence over everything else except parentheses. Thus, the product rule is \\[(fg)' = f'g + fg'\\] where the right-side of the equation means “the function \\(f'\\) multiplied by the function \\(g\\) plus the function \\(g'\\) multiplied by the function \\(f\\).”\nWhen using the \\(\\partial_x\\) notation, \\(\\partial_x\\) has precedence over evaluation whenever there is a matching \\(x\\) in the expression being evaluated. For instance:\n\n\\(\\partial_x f(x=2)\\) means, “apply the function \\(\\partial_x f(x)\\) to the specific input 2.”\n\\(\\partial_x f(x) \\left.{\\Large\\strut}\\right|_{x=2}\\) means the same thing as (i).\n\\(\\partial_x f(2)\\) means something different: “Evaluate \\(f()\\) on the specific input 2. The result will be a specific output value. The derivative of a specific output value will always be zero.”\n\n\nThat leaves the question of \\(\\partial_x f()\\). There is no mention of \\(x\\) being the input to \\(f()\\). So we will deem \\(\\partial_x f()\\) to be sloppy and ambiguous. We will try to avoid this usage. Draw any such cases to the authors’ attention so they can be corrected.\nSuppose we define two functions: \\(f(x) \\equiv x^2/2\\) and \\(g(x) \\equiv x/2\\). With these definitions, evaluate the expressions given below.\n\n\\(\\partial_t g(t=2)\\)\n\n\n 0        1/2        1        2        Sloppy       \n\nquestion id: crow-begin-bottle-1\n\n\n\n\\(\\partial_x g(t=2)\\)\n\n\n 0        1/2        1        2        Sloppy       \n\nquestion id: crow-begin-bottle-2\n\n\n\n\\(\\partial_t f(x=2) g(t=2)\\)\n\n\n 0        1/2        1        2        Sloppy       \n\nquestion id: crow-begin-bottle-3\n\n\n\n\\(\\partial_x f(2)\\, g(t=2)\\)\n\n\n 0        1/2        1        2        Sloppy       \n\nquestion id: crow-begin-bottle-4\n\n\n\n\\(\\partial_x f(x=1)\\)\n\n\n 0        1/2        1        2        Sloppy       \n\nquestion id: crow-begin-bottle-5\n\n\n\n\\(\\partial_x f() g()\\)\n\n\n 0        1/2        1        2        Sloppy       \n\nquestion id: crow-begin-bottle-6\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11 Figure 7 shows a close up of a function around a reference point at the center of the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\nFor the following questions, estimate by eye these derivatives of the function at the reference point \\((x_0=-2, y_0=-5)\\).\n\nWhat is the numerical value of \\(\\partial_x g(x,y)\\) at the reference point?\n\n\n -1        -0.50        -0.25        0        0.25        0.50        1       \n\nquestion id: partial-tan-1\n\n\n\nWhat is the numerical value of \\(\\partial_y g(x,y)\\) at the reference point?\n\n\n -1        -0.50        -0.25        0        0.25        0.50        1       \n\nquestion id: partial-tan-2\n\n\nThe next questions ask about second-order partial derivatives. As you know, the second derivative is about how the first derivative changes with x or y. Insofar as the function is a simple inclined plane, where the contours would be straight, parallel, and evenly spaced, the second derivatives would all be zero. But you can see that it is not such a plane: the contours curve a bit.\nIn determining the second derivatives by eye from the graph, you are encouraged to compare first derivatives at the opposing edges of the graph, as opposed to at very nearby points.\n\nWhat is the sign of \\(\\partial_{xx} g(x,y)\\) at the reference point?\n\n\n negative        positive       \n\nquestion id: partial-tan-3\n\n\n\nWhat is the sign of \\(\\partial_{yy} g(x,y)\\) at the reference point?\n\n\n negative        positive       \n\nquestion id: partial-tan-4\n\n\n\nWhat is the sign of \\(\\partial_{xy} g(x,y)\\) at the reference point?\n\n\n negative        positive       \n\nquestion id: partial-tan-5\n\n\n\nWhat is the sign of \\(\\partial_{yx} g(x,y)\\) at the reference point?\n\n\n negative        positive       \n\nquestion id: partial-tan-6\n\n\n\n\nExercise 20 For almost everyone, a house is too expensive to buy with cash, so people need to borrow money. The usual form of the loan is called a “mortgage”. Mortgages extend over many years and involve paying a fixed amount each month. That amount is calculated so that, by paying it each month for the duration of the mortgage, the last payment will completely repay the amount borrowed plus the accumulated interest.\nThe monthly mortgage payment in dollars, \\(P\\), for a house is a function of three quantities, \\[P(A, r, N)\\] where \\(A\\) is the amount borrowed in dollars, \\(r\\) is the interest rate (percentage points per year), and \\(N\\) is the number of years before the mortgage is paid off.\nA studio apartment is selling for $220,000. You will need to borrow $184,000 to make the purchase.\n\nSuppose \\(P(184000,4,10) = 2180.16\\). What does this tell you in financial terms?\n\n\n\n The monthly cost of borrowing $184,000 for 10 years at 4% interest per year.\n\n\n The monthly cost of borrowing $184,000 for 4 years at 10% interest per year.\n\n\n The annual cost of the mortgage at 4% interest for 10 years.\n\n\n The annual cost of the mortgage at 10% interest for 4 years\n\n\n\nquestion id: partial-house-1\n\n\nThe next two questions involve what happens to the monthly mortgage payments if you change either the amount or duration of the mortgage.

Zoom in gradually (say, size = 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01) until you reach a point where the surface plot is (practically) a pretty simple inclined plane.\nFrom the contour plot, zoomed in so that the graph shows an inclined plane, figure out the sign of \\(\\partial_x g(0,0)\\) and \\(\\partial_y g(0,0)\\).\nWhich answer best describes the signs of the partial derivatives of \\(g(x,y)\\) at the reference point \\((x_0=0, y_0=0)\\)?\n\n\n \\(\\partial_x g(0,0)\\) is pos, \\(\\partial_y g(0,0)\\) is pos\n\n\n \\(\\partial_x g(0,0)\\) is pos, \\(\\partial_y g(0,0)\\) is neg\n\n\n \\(\\partial_x g(0,0)\\) is neg, \\(\\partial_y g(0,0)\\) is neg\n\n\n \\(\\partial_x g(0,0)\\) is neg, \\(\\partial_y g(0,0)\\) is pos.\n\n\n \\(\\partial_x g(0,0)\\) is 0, \\(\\partial_y g(0,0)\\) is pos\n\n\n\nquestion id: partial-purple-1\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14 In economic theory, the quantity of the demand for any good is a decreasing function of the price of that good and an increasing function of the price of a competing good.\nThe classical example is that apple juice competes with orange juice. The demand for orange juice is in units of thousands of liters of orange juice. The price is in units of dollars per liter.\nHere’s a graph with the input quantities unlabeled. The contour labels indicate the demand for orange juice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of partial derivatives makes it much easier to think about the situation. There are two partial derivative functions relevant to the function in the graph. Well denote the inputs apple and orange, but remember that these are the prices of those commodities in dollars per liter.\n\n\\(\\partial_\\text{apple} \\text{demand}()\\) – how the demand changes when apple-juice price goes up, holding orange-juice price constant. (Another notation that is more verbose but perhaps easier to read \\(\\frac{\\partial\\, \\text{demand}}{\\partial\\,\\text{apple}}\\))\n\\(\\partial_\\text{orange} \\text{demand}()\\) – how the demand changes when orange-juice price goes up, holding apple-juice price constant. (Another notation: \\(\\frac{\\partial\\, \\text{demand}}{\\partial\\,\\text{orange}}\\))\n\nNotice that the notation names both the output and the single input which is to be changed–the other inputs will be held constant.\nThe first paragraph of this problem gives the economic theory which amounts to saying that one of the partial derivatives is positive and the other negative.\n\nWhat is the proper translation of the notation \\(\\partial_\\text{apple}\\text{demand}()\\)?\n\n\n\n The partial derivative of orange-juice demand with repect to apple-juice price\n\n\n The partial derivative of apple-juice price with respect to demand for orange juice\n\n\n The partial derivative of apple-juice demand with respect to price of apple juice\n\n\n The partial derivative of orange-juice price with respect to apple-juice price.\n\n\n\nquestion id: spider-blow-lamp-1\n\n\n\nAccording to the economic theory described above, one of the partial derivatives will be positive and the other negative.

One slice is for age 20, one slice for age 30, and the last for age 40. This is a standard graphical format in the technical literature, sometimes called an interaction plot since it emphasizes the interaction between age and dose.\nFigure 9 shows three contour plots.

The particular function we will consider here is Dr(), intended to help answer the question, “Should you go to the doctor?”\n\\[\\text{Dr}(d, c, p,  e,  n, s) = \\frac{\\frac{s^2}{2} + e(n-e)}{100 -  3(d + \\frac{p^3}{70} - c)}\\] where\n\n\\(d\\) = How many days in the past month have you been incapacitated? \\(d_0 \\equiv 3\\)\n\\(c\\) = Does the issue seem to be getting better or worse. (-10 to 10 with -10 being “circling the drain” and 10 being “dramatic improvement”) \\(c_0 \\equiv -2\\)\n\\(p\\) = How much pain or discomfort are you currently experiencing? (1-10 with 10 being “currently holding detached toe in Ziploc bag”) \\(p_0 = 3\\)\n\\(e\\) = How embarrassing is this issue? (1-10 with 10 being “slipped on ice and fell on 1972 Mercedes-Benz hood ornament, which is now part of my body”) \\(e_0 = 4\\)\n\\(n\\) = How noticeable is the issue? (1-10 with 10 being “fell asleep on waffle iron”) \\(n_0 = 5\\)\n\\(s\\) = How serious does the issue seem? (1-10 with 10 being “may well have nail embedded in frontal lobe [of brain]”) \\(s_0 = 3\\)\n\nAlthough the function is offered tongue-in-cheek, let’s examine it to see if it even roughly matches common sense. The tool we will use relates to low-order polynomial approximation around a reference point and examining appropriate partial derivatives. To save time, we stipulate a reference point for you, noted in the description of quantities above.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\nThe code creates an R implementation of the function that is set up so that the default values of the inputs are those at the given reference point. You can use this in a sandbox to try different changes in each of the input quantities.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nAccording to the instructions in Geek Logic, if Dr()\\(&gt; 1\\), you should go to the doctor.\nEssay 1: The value of Dr() at the reference point is 0.10, indicating that you shouldn’t go to the doctor. But we don’t yet know whether 0.10 is very close to the decision threshold of 1 or very far away. Describe a reasonable way to figure this out. Report your description and the results here.\n  question id: partial-doctor-1 \nEssay 2: There are six inputs to the function. Go through the list of all six and (without thinking too hard about it) write down for all of them your intuitive sense of whether an increase of one point in that input should raise or lower the output of Dr() at the reference point. Also write down whether you think the input should be a large or small determinant of whether to go to the doctor. (You don’t need to refer to the Dr() function itself, just to your own intuitive sense of what should be the effect of each of the inputs.)\n  question id: partial-doctor-2 \nThe operator D() can calculate partial derivatives. You can calculate the value of a partial derivative very easily at the reference point, using an expression like this, which gives the value of the partial of Dr() with respect to input \\(s\\) at the reference point:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe are now going to use these partial derivatives to compare your intuition about going to the doctor to what the function has to say. Of course, we don’t know yet whether the function is reasonable, so don’t be disappointed if your intuition conflicts with the function.\nEssay 3: Calculate the numerical value of each of the partial derivatives at the reference point. List them here and say, for each one, whether it accords with your intuition.\n  question id: partial-doctor-3 \n\n\nExercise 19 Let’s return to the water skier in XREF not implemented yet. When we left her, the rope was being pulled in at 10 feet per second and her corresponding speed on the water was 10.05 feet per second. The relationship between the rope speed and the skier’s speed was \\[dx = \\frac{L}{x} dL\\] and, due to the right-angle configuration of the tow system, \\(x^2 = L^2 - H^2\\).\nWhat happens to \\(dx\\) as \\(L\\) gets smaller with \\(dL\\) being the same? We need to keep in mind that \\(dx\\) depends on three things: \\(dL\\), \\(L\\), and \\(x\\). But we can substitute in the Pythagorean relationship between \\(x\\), \\(L\\), and (fixed) \\(H\\) to get \\[dx = \\frac{L}{\\strut\\sqrt{L^2 - H^2}}\\ dL\\ .\\] This is bad news for the skier who holds on too long! As \\(L\\) approaches \\(H\\), the rope becomes more and more vertical and the skier’s water speed becomes greater and greater, approaching \\(\\infty\\) as \\(L \\rightarrow H\\).\nYou, an engineer brought in to solve this dangerous possibility, have proposed to have the winch slow down as the rope is reeled in. How should the speed of the rope be set so that the skier’s water speed remains safely constant?\nWhat formula for \\(dL\\) will allow \\(dx\\) to stay constant at a value \\(v\\)?\n\n\n \\(dL = dx\\)\n\n\n \\(dL = v \\sqrt{L^2 - H^2}{L}\\)\n\n\n \\(dL = v \\sqrt{L^2 - H^2}\\)\n\n\n There is no such formula.\n\n\n\nquestion id: shark-bite-sheet-1\n\n\n\n25-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

The results are shown in 4 different ways:\n\nThe coefficients on the model\nA contour plot of the model\nA surface plot of the model\nA slice plot showing speed as a function of gear for three different slopes of road.\n\nYou might find some of these displays more useful than others. Feel free to comment out (with a #) the ones that you don’t find useful.\nNotice that the “model formula” in the lm() function is\nV ~ s + g + I(s*g) + I(g^2)\nThis expression contains just the input quantities in the model. The lm() function does the work of finding the best coefficients for a linear combination of those terms. In the following questions, you’re going to remove terms (such as + I(s*g) from the model formula) to see what happens to the model. In one of the questions, you will extend the formula with a - 1 (which suppresses the intercept term that is ordinarily included in models).\n…\n\nBicycle_speed &lt;- tibble::tribble(\n    ~ s, ~ g, ~ V,\n    8, 1, 2,\n    8, 5, 1,\n    8, 10,0,\n    0, 1, 9,\n    0, 5, 12,\n    0, 10, 6,\n   -8, 1, 12,\n   -8, 5, 16,\n   -8, 10, 20\n)\n# fit the model to the data\nmod &lt;- lm(V ~ s + g + I(s*g) + I(g^2) , data = Bicycle_speed)\nknitr::kable(coef(mod))\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n6.7777778\n\n\ns\n-0.5686475\n\n\ng\n0.9666667\n\n\nI(s * g)\n-0.0691598\n\n\nI(g^2)\n-0.0777778\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmod_fun &lt;- makeFun(mod) # turn the statistical model into a function\ndom &lt;- bounds(s = c(-8, 8), g = c(1, 10))\ncontour_plot(mod_fun(s, g) ~ s + g, dom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninteractive_plot(mod_fun(s, g) ~ s + g, dom)\n\nLoading required namespace: plotly\n\n\n\n\n\nslice_plot(mod_fun(s=0, g) ~ g, bounds(g=c(1,10)),\n           color = \"red\", label_text = \"flat\") %&gt;%\n  slice_plot(mod_fun(s = -5, g) ~ g, color = \"black\",\n             label_text = \"downhill\") %&gt;%\n  slice_plot(mod_fun(s = 5, g) ~ g, color = \"blue\",\n             label_text = \"uphill\")%&gt;%\n  gf_labs(y = \"Bike velocity (mph)\", x = \"Gear #\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssay: The lm() function automatically adds an \"intercept\" term to the model. You can suppress this by ending the model formula with -1. Explain briefly what happens when you suppress the intercept and to what extent that model makes sense for the bicycle situation.\n\nRestore the sandbox to its original before you answer this question.\n\nEssay: The interaction term in the model is included by the + I(s*g) component of the model formula. (Don’t get confused: \"Interaction\" and \"intercept\" are completely different things.) Take out the interaction term, refit and re-display the model. Explain briefly what happens when you suppress the interaction term and to what extent that model makes sense for the bicycle situation.\n\nRestore the sandbox to its original before you answer this question.\n\nEssay: Suppose you add in a quadratic term in s to the model. Explain briefly whether this changes the model a lot or not. Also, look at the coefficients found by lm() for this extended model. What about those coefficients accounts for whether the model changed by a little or a lot.\n\nRestore the sandbox to its original before you answer this question.\n\nEssay: Add a new plot to the code box. It should be just like the slice-plot that was originally there, but instead of each slice holding road slope constant and showing velocity as a function of gear, change things so that gear is held constant and the plot shows velocity as a function of road slope. Explain in everyday terms what this new plot displays about the model and say whether you think it makes sense.",

But with \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} x \\ln(x)\\) we have a situation of \\(0 \\times \\infty\\). However, \\[x \\ln(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{1/x}\\] which makes it clearer that \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} x \\ln(x)\\) is a matter of comparing the two functions \\(\\ln(x)\\) and \\(1/x\\). The limit \\(x \\rightarrow 0\\) is of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is \\(-\\infty\\) while for \\(1/x\\) it is \\(\\infty\\). Thus we have a indeterminate form problem of \\(-\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}\\). This can be handled by l’Hopital’s Rule.\nHere, the rule has the form:\n\\[\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\left[ \\frac{\\ln(x)}{1/x} \\right] = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\left[\\frac{\\partial_x \\ln(x)}{\\partial_x 1/x}\\right] \\tag{1}\\]\nCompute the derivatives on the right-hand side of Math expression 1 and simplify the algebra.\n\nWhat does \\[\\left[\\frac{\\partial_x \\ln(x)}{\\partial_x 1/x}\\right]\\] simplify to?\n\n\n \\(x\\)        \\(-x\\)        \\(1/x\\)        \\(-1/x\\)       \n\nquestion id: dolphin-mean-linen-2\n\n\nTake the limit as \\(x \\rightarrow 0\\) of the simplifed form.

Instead, we will have to use just a few coefficients. But how many is enough?\nThe function make_poly() defined in Active R chunk 2 can create a function given a fiducial point \\(x_0\\) and a few coefficients at the start of the Taylor polynomial.\nFor example, the coefficients for \\(e^x\\) (around \\(x_0 = 0\\)) are \\(1, 1, 1/2, 1/6, 1/24, 1/120, 1/720, 1/5040, 1/40320, 1/362880, ...\\) Factorials get big fast!\nThe sandbox shows a simple comparison of the polynomial approximation to the actual exponential function. it plots the magnitude of the error \\(|e^x - p(x)|\\) on a log-log scale.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nRead the graph carefully to make sure you understand what is being displayed.\n\nIt is easy to think about the “absolute error” scale as indicating the number of zeros after the decimal point in the size of the error. For example 1e-6 is 0.000001. The approximation has that much error or less for \\(|x| &lt; 0.3\\).\nWe are using log-log scales because we anticipated that the error would be something like a power law. (Why? Because the first term omitted from the approximation will produce a function \\(a_{n+1} x^{n+1}\\), a power law. And when a power-law function is plotted on log-log axes, it appears as a straight line.) But we cannot graph negative values of \\(x\\) on a log scale. So we are plotting both \\(p(x)\\) and \\(p(-x)\\) together. The error for negative \\(x\\) values are plotted in red.\n\nFor \\(x \\approx 2.0\\), the magnitude of the error is, to judge from the graph, 1e-1. When written as a decimal number, how many leading zeros are after the decimal point?\n\n -2        -1        0        1        2       \n\nquestion id: fawn-hear-kayak-1\n\n\nFor \\(x \\approx 10.0\\), the magnitude of the error is, to judge from the graph, 1e4.

It will help to see the relationships if we write each of them in a common form. To that end, we will write each as a linear combination of power-law functions with integer exponents. Each of these linear series involves an infinite number of power-law functions.\n\nexponential function\\[e^x = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} + \\cdots\\]\nsine function \\[\\sin(x) = 0 + \\frac{x}{1!} + 0 - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + 0 + \\frac{x^5}{5!} + \\cdots\\]\ncosine function \\[\\cos(x) = 1 + 0 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + 0 + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + 0 + \\cdots\\]\n“natural” logarithm\\[\\ln(1+x) = 0 + \\frac{x}{1} - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\frac{x^5}{5} + \\cdots\\]\n\nWe ask you to memorize each of these four infinite series. Since it is impractical to memorize an ionfinite number of things, we will give you a system so that there are only a small number of facts needed.\n\nEach term in each series will be given an index $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \nEvery term involves multiplying the power law function \\(x^n\\) by a number. Except for the \\(\\ln(1+x)\\) function, that number is always \\(1/n!\\) multiplied by a sign, which can be \\(-1, 0\\), or \\(1\\).\n\nHere are the patterns of the signs:\n\n\n\nfunction\nx0\nx1\nx2\nx3\nx4\nx5\nx6\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(e^x\\)\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\n\\(\\cos(x)\\)\n+\n0\n-\n0\n+\n0\n-\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\n\\(\\sin(x)\\)\n0\n+\n0\n-\n0\n+\n0\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\n\\(\\ln(1+x)\\)\n0\n+\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\n\\(\\cdots\\)\n\n\n\nNotice that the signs of the \\(\\cos(x)\\) function cycle with a period of 4, so the sign of term \\(n+4\\) equals the sign of term \\(n\\). Same with the \\(\\sin(x)\\), but the signs are shifted one slot.\nThe series all extend to \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\).

The approximation should go exactly through the coordinate pair \\((x_0=0, y=0)\\) shown as a bright dot on the graph. Notice that the approximation is exacty tangent to the sinusoid at \\(x_0 = 0\\): the approximating line goes straight through the dot and continues pretty much through the center of the thick line marking the sinusoid, until the sinusoid curves away from the straight line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw your own graph of a sinusoid so that you can sketch on top of it the polynomial approximations you will design.\nStart with sketching in a third-order polynomial that approximates the sinusoid near \\(x_0=0\\). The general formula for a third order polynomial is \\[\\text{third}(x) \\equiv \\overbrace{\\underbrace{b_0 + b_1 x^1}_\\text{first-order polynomial} + b_2 x^2}^\\text{second-order polynomial} + b_3 x^3\\] To turn the first-order approximation into a third-order approximation algebraically, you would need to choose the coefficients \\(b_2\\) and \\(b_3\\). You want to choose the best possible \\(b_2\\) and \\(b_3\\) to stay close to the sinusoid. Of course, you could take the lazy person’s approach and choose \\(b_2 = b_3 = 0\\). If you did that, you would have the first-order polynomial. Here’s the important point: the best third-order polynomial will not be any worse than the first-order polynomial, but it can be better!\nRemember what you know about the shape of third-order polynomials:\n\nOne tail will go up, the other down.\nThere can be both an argmin and an argmax.\n\nRepeat (1), sketching out a 5th-order polynomial. Again, one tail will go up and the other down. But now there can be two argmaxes and two argmins that alternate along the \\(x\\) axis: min, max, min, max.\nOne more time, sketching now a 7th-order polynomial. Just like the first-, third-, and fifth-order polynomial, for the 7th one tail will go up and the other down. There can be as many as three argmaxes and three argmins. They will alternate: between any two argmaxes, there will be one argmin.\n\n\n\nExercise 11 We would like to write a Taylor-series polynomial for \\(\\dnorm(x)\\). To do this, we will need the folling numbers \\[\\dnorm(x_0),\\ \\ \\partial_x \\dnorm(x_0),\\ \\ \\partial_{xx} \\dnorm(x_0),\\ \\ \\partial_{xxx} \\dnorm(x_0), ...\\]\n\n(To warm up.)

We’ll focus on the number of people (in the hypothetical population) still living. Here’s the data, along with a not-very-good function approximating the data.

You’re going to make it better using the same technique we used with the mortality vs age data. Specifically, instead of the tilde expression nliving/100000 ~ age, you will use nliving/100000 ~ ns(age,??), where the ?? must be replaced with a small integer saying how many basis functions to use.

It’s the same function mathematically as the one you created in the sandbox (using the correct answer to the previous question).\nThe function prob_living() is our model of someone living to a given age, but who is that person. The way prob_living() is written, that person is someone just born. But, insofar as we are interested in the present value of Social Security payments made to a person who starts at age 67, we have to take it for granted that this person is still alive. So the probablity that a (relevant) person is alive at 67 is 100%. We need to modify prob_living() to take this into account. This is easy; just divide prob_living() by its numerical value at age 67. That will make the overall output 100% at age 67.\n0.7291\n\n\n 0.8143\n\n\n 0.8574\n\n\n 0.9105\n\n\n\nquestion id: retirement-8\nNow we can put together all the components we need for component (3) as described above: the present value of the instantaneous average Social Security payment to a person of age \\(y\\).\n24000 * exp(0.02*(y-67)) * prob_living(y)/0.8574\nUsing R, implement this function, and accumulate it from age 67 to age 100.

At first it might seem to you that the probability of dying at age \\(y\\) is 1 - prob_living(y) (in otherwords the opposite of probability of dying at any exact age in the opposite of probability of survival), but that’s not true.

    "text": "Misunderstanding life expectancy\nWhat’s there to mis-understand about life expectancy? I’m not referring to the calculation itself, which puts together some challenging concepts like differentiation, integration, and function fitting.\nThe fundamental mistake is to use the short form of the name, “life expectancy” rather than the full name, “life expectancy at age ___.” The number you hear about is “life expectancy at birth.”\nPeople use life expectancy at birth to make decisions about things for which it is misleading. For instance, in public debates about health care, you will often hear that other rich nations have longer life expectancy than the US even though they spend half as much money per capita on health care. But the low US life expectancy is shaped largely by some features not so relevant to health care: the relatively high infant mortality in the US (which has it’s own set of factors), the high teenager mortality (which is not as clear when only looking at the data for females), gun deaths, etc.\nSince the large majority of health-care spending is for seniors, we should look at the outcome for seniors. For instance, we might want to look at life expectancy at age 67. Let’s calculate that. Note that the calculation is the same as the above, but prob_living(y) has been adjusted so that it applies to people who reach age 67.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nEssay 3: For the following essay, ensure that your answer is in the form of complete sentences and utilizes proper grammar.

Color is not a property of a mathematical vector. Orientation, however, is.\n\n\n\nMeasure the length of each vector. (Hint: Use a ruler! You can round to the nearest millimeter.)\nFind the included angle between the \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}\\) and \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{brown}}\\) vectors. (Your answer should be correct to within \\(\\pm 15^\\circ\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nAbout 135 degrees. Note that the orientation makes a difference. The angle is measured with the vectors placed tail to tail.\n\n\n\nFind the included angle between the \\(\\color{magenta}{\\text{magenta}}\\) and \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}\\) vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nMagenta points in the same direction as brown, so the answer is the same as in the previous question.\n\n\n\nFind the included angle between 0.7 times the \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}\\) vector and -11.3 times the \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{brown}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nThe scaling does not matter except that the negative sign for the brown vector means that its orientation will be reversed. This means that the included angle will be 45 degrees, not 135 degrees as in the previous two questions.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Suppose \\[\\vec{\\mathbf u} \\equiv  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}4\\\\-3\\end{array}\\right)  \\  \\  \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\vec{\\mathbf v} \\equiv  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}2\\\\2\\end{array}\\right)\\ .\\] The following questions ask you to compute the length of the vector given.

The concrete block is an “acoustic mirror.” Its purpose is to collect and reflect sound from an aircraft, concentrating them at a point where they can be picked up by a microphone. Moving the microphone to a point where the concentrated sound is strongest allows the aircraft’s bearing to be identified, helping observers acquire the aircraft visually.\n\nSource\nFigure 2 shows how, with two or more such acoustic mirrors, the location of the aircraft can be identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nGive the position of the aircraft as a multiple of \\(\\vec{a}\\) from sound mirror A and as a multiple of \\(\\vec{b}\\) from sound mirror B.

Hold a pencil perpendicular to the paper with the eraser on the dot. Now, (using a pen!) draw a vector on the paper that is perpendicular to the pencil. Now draw 5 more vectors, each different from the other, that are all perpendicular to the pencil.\nDraw a vector \\(\\vec{c}\\) on the paper. Now draw another vector on the paper that is perpendicular to the first. Label it \\(\\vec{a}\\). Find another vector, to be labeled \\(\\vec{b}\\) that lies on the paper, is orthogonal to \\(\\vec{c}\\), and has a different direction from \\(\\vec{a}\\). It will turn out that \\(\\vec{a} = k \\vec{b}\\). Write down the numerical value of the scalar \\(k\\) for your \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\).\nConsider the vector \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (2, 5)^T\\). Using only arithmetic, find some other vector \\(\\vec{z}\\) that is perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w}\\). (Hint: To be perpendicular, \\(\\vec{z}^T \\cdot \\vec{w}\\) must be zero. So make up two numbers such \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(2 a + 5 b  = 0\\).) Write \\(\\vec{z}\\) on your paper.\nRepeat (c) and create another vector \\(\\vec{z}_2\\) that is different from \\(\\vec{z}\\). Write \\(\\vec{z}_2\\) on your paper. In addition, find the scalar \\(k\\) such that \\(\\vec{z}_2 = k \\vec{z}\\).\n\nIn the following exercises, you are asked to find numerical vectors that are perpendicular (“orthogonal”) to the stated vector. This is equivalent to finding a new vector whose dot product with the stated vector is zero. (Except … the new vector cannot be all zeros! The all-zero vector is exceptional and has no direction.) One effective strategy is to write down a vector consisting of a 1 in any position you like and zeros elsewhere. Find the dot product, calling it \\(d\\). Then select one of the zeros to turn it non-zero. What value should it have? Just enough so that when included in the dot product it contributes \\(-d\\).\n\nConsider the vector \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (1,  2,  -3, 2)^T\\).\n\nFind a vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) that is perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w}\\).\nFind another vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) that is perpendicular both to \\(\\vec{w}\\) and to \\(\\vec{a}\\). (Hint: It can be done.)\nCreate yet another vector \\(\\vec{c}\\) that is a linear combination of \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\). (You can choose whatever combination you like, but both coefficients should be non-zero.) What is the angle between \\(\\vec{c}\\) and \\(\\vec{w}\\)?\n\nYou have been sent on a mission to 5-dimensional space. Your task is to find a vector that is perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (2,1,3,3,-4)^T\\). Do so.\nBONUS. Find as many vectors as you can that are perpendicular to \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv (2,1,3,3,-4)^T\\) and to each other. The arithmetic will not necessarily be easy. When you give up (with honor!), figure out how many mutually perpendicular vectors there can be in 5-dimensional space. How about 10-dimensional space?\n\n\n\nExercise 8 In physics and engineering, there is a very important operation called the cross product and written \\(\\vec{u}\\times\\vec{v}\\). The operation is only defined for vectors in 3-dimensional space. The output of the cross product is another 3-dimensional vector which can be calculated arithmetically as:\n\\[\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a\\\\b\\\\c\\end{array}\\right) \\times \\left(\\begin{array}{c}e\\\\f\\\\g\\end{array}\\right) \\equiv\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}b\\, g - c\\, f\\\\c\\, e - a\\, g\\\\a\\, f - b\\, e\\end{array}\\right)\\]\nMake up coordinates for two three-dimensional vectors \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\) that point in different directions.\nCalculate the cross product \\(\\vec{w} \\equiv \\vec{u} \\times \\vec{v}\\).\n\nFind the angle between \\(\\vec{w}\\) and \\(\\vec{u}\\).\nFind the angle between \\(\\vec{w}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n\nOther than this brief description, we will not use cross products at all in this course. But keep them in mind for your upcoming physics and engineering courses.\n\n30-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Being a point, the target has a definite location relative to the coordinate axes.\n“Solving” this sort of system amounts to finding a linear combination of the two vectors whose result is a vector that can connect the origin to the target. (We call this a target problem.)\n\nCopy over each diagram to your paper. (Any reasonable approximation will do.) Then, for each diagram, find the linear combination of the two vectors that will reach from the origin to the target. Show your work, meaning that you should draw the scaled vectors in a proper position that demonstrates that they do indeed connect the origin to the target. Underneath the diagram, write down the numerical value of the scalars in the linear combination. (Again, any reasonable approximation will do.)\n\n31-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Suppose the dimension of the output of a function \\(v(t)\\) is \\(L/T\\), for instance, meters-per-second.\nThe anti-derivative function \\(V(t) \\equiv \\int v(t) dt\\) will also have dimension and units.\nRecall that in constructing the anti-derivative using the Euler method, we multiply the values of \\(v(t)\\) times some small increment in the input, \\(h\\). Therefore the dimension of the output of \\(V(t)\\) will be \\([v(t)] [t]\\). So if \\([v(t)] = L/T\\), the dimension \\([V(t)] [t] = L T/T = L\\). Units for such a dimension would be, for instance, meters.

From the data, we plotted out \\(\\ln\\left[P(y)\\right]\\) and found a fairly smooth curve that was upward sloping and concave down. Next, we made a plot of the derivative with respect to year of that upward-sloping, concave-down curve and found the derivative to be well approximated by a straight-line function with a negative slope \\(a - b y\\). In other words, we found \\[\\partial_y \\ln(P(y)) = a - b\\,y\\] We want to figure out \\(P(y)\\) from this relationship.\nStep 1: Anti-differentiate the functions on both sides of the equation. Anti-differentiation has the effect of cancelling out the \\(\\partial_y\\) from the left side of the equation. Anti-differentiating the right side means calculating \\(\\int \\left[a - b\\, y\\right]\\ dy\\).\nTask 1: Confirm that \\(\\int \\left[a - b\\,y\\right]dy = a y - \\frac{1}{2} b y^2 + C\\).\nStep 2: From Step 1 we have translated the relationship between population and year into this form:\n\\[\\ln(P(y)) = a y - \\frac{1}{2} b y^2 + C\\]\nTask 2: Exponentiate both sides of the newly framed relationship to get \\[P(y) = \\exp\\left(a y - \\frac{1}{2} b y^2 + C\\right) = e^{ay -b y^2} e^C = A e^{ay -b y^2}\\] where \\(A = e^C\\).\nStep 3: Let’s declare that \\(y=0\\) means year 2020.\nTask 3: Find the census estimate of the population in 2020 and use that information to estimate the parameter \\(A\\) in \\(P(y) = A e^{ay-b y^2}\\).\nStep 4: The per-capita growth rate is \\[G(y) \\equiv \\frac{\\partial_y P(y)}{P(y)} \\approx \\frac{\\partial_y A e^{a y - b y^2}}{A e^{ay - b y^2}} = a - 2 b y\\] The data suggest that the current growth rate is about 1% per year, so \\(G(0) = a =  \\approx 0.01\\). We also know that the growth rate will be around zero in 2070 years time. Year 2070 corresponds to \\(y=50\\). Consequently, \\(G(50) = 0.01 - 2\\cdot 50\\cdot b\\approx 0\\). You can easily solve this for \\(b\\).\nTask 4: You now have numerical estimates for the parameters \\(A\\), \\(a\\), and \\(b\\) in the function \\(P(y)\\). Using these parameters, plot out \\(P(y)\\) for the next 200 years. According to the prediction, what will be the population in year 2220?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nExercise 10 A textbook might have a problem like this: \\[\\text{Find}\\ \\ \\int\\! x^2 dx\\] This is a command to you, the student, to find a simpler algebraic form for the function \\(\\int x^2 dx\\). The answer the textbook seeks is, of course, \\[\\frac{1}{3} x^3 + C\\].\nI would rather textbooks say: “Write an algebraic expression for the anti-derivative of the function \\(f(x) \\equiv x^2\\).” We don’t really need the \\(\\int\\) involved.\nNow consider a textbook problem like this: \\[\\text{Find}\\ \\ \\int_{500}^{1000}\\!\\! \\frac{x^2}{10000000}dx\\]\nThe 0 and 10 here are the “limits of integration.” (The word “limit” here does not have any connection to the concept of “limits” we studied in defining the derivative of a function.) Maybe it would be better to say, “0 to 10 are the bounds of integration.” The idea is that we will accumulate the quantity \\(x^2 / 10000000\\) over the interval \\(500 \\leq x \\leq 1000\\).\nTo be more concrete, watch the first 30 seconds or so of the following video, which shows a truck laying out traffic cones along a road with a few moments showing the “anti” operation of collecting the cones.\n\n\nPut yourself on the scene when the construction site is being set up, a first step of which is to mark off the construction zone with traffic cones. That is what the truck is doing at the start of the video.\nSuppose the truck is at position \\(x\\) along the road. At that position, there are \\(f(x)\\) cones on the truck. We will call this the “cone stock” on the truck. The function \\(\\partial_x f(x)\\) is the derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\): As the truck drives along the road, that is, as \\(x\\) increases, the truck is unloading its stock of cones. How fast is this unloading? In the video it looks like it is about 1 cone every 33 feet, or let’s say 3 cones per hundred feet. That is, the quantity \\(f(x)\\) is changing at a rate of 3 cones per hundred feet: \\(\\partial_x f(x) = -0.03\\). The derivative function is a constant: the cones are being placed evenly along the road.\nNow imagine yourself on another day at another place, at the end of construction. The job of the truck is to pick up the cones. Imagine that the density of cones is described by the function \\(g(x)\\). If we evaluate \\(g(x)\\) at a specific point on the road, we get the density of cones at that point for example 6 cones per 100 feet (0.06 cones/foot). The truck has already picked up some cones and is continuing to do so. Suppose that the contractor or laid out the cones was not very good: they weren’t put down at a regular spacing. Instead, in some spots the cones were put close together: so \\(g(x)\\) is large. In other places the cones are far apart: \\(g(x)\\) is small. The higher is \\(g(x)\\), the more densely the cones are spaced.\nAs it drives along the road, the truck pick up the cones. Suppose the truck is at mile marker 1.3, equivalent to 6864 feet from marker 0. The truck picks up cones until reaching mile marker 2.4: equivalent to 12,672 feet from marker 0. How many cones did the truck pick up? Easy, it is: \\[\\int_{6864}^{12,672} g(x) dx\\] The cone density along the road, \\(g(x)\\), is a function of position. But the accumulation from mile marker 1.3 to marker 2.4 is not a function: it is a number of cones. Note the units: \\(g(x)\\) is cones/foot while \\(\\int g(x)dx\\) is simply cones.\nNow, we might prefer to keep track of the cone stock as the truck drives along the road. This would simply be a matter of counting the number of cones on the truck at each point \\(x\\) along the road. Of course this number is changing with \\(x\\): the stock is a function of \\(x\\). This stock function is what we are trying to find when we anti-differentiate \\(g(x)\\). If we know \\(g(x)\\)—the density of cones along the road—we can figure out \\(G(x)\\).\nIt is not quite the case that \\(G(x)\\) is the stock on the truck. to know that, we would have to know how many cones were on the truck when it started out. All we know for certain is that the flow of cones onto the truck (with respect to road position \\(x\\)) is the derivative of \\(G(x)\\) w.r.t. \\(x\\). That is, the flow onto the truck is \\(\\partial_x G(x) = g(x)\\).\nWhen we know \\(G(x)\\) we don’t exactly know the stock on the truck. But from \\(G(x)\\) we can exactly calculate how many cones the truck accumulated from mile marker 1.3 (6864 ft) to 2.4 (12,762 ft). That accumulated number will be \\[G(12672) - G(6864)\\] Back to the textbook problem: \\[\\text{Find}\\ \\ \\int_{500}^{1000}\\!\\! \\frac{x^2}{10000000}dx\\]\nIn terms of road construction, think of this as the number of cones picked up when driving from position 500 ft to position 1000 ft. Evidently, at the start of the run—that is, at \\(x=500\\), the density of cones is \\(500^2 / 10000000 =  0.025\\) cones per foot: one cone every 40 feet. At the end of the run—position \\(x=1000\\)—the density is 0.1 cones per foot: one cone every 10 feet.\nThe answer to the textbook problem will be a number of cones. To find that number, we can follow this procedure:\n\nFind an anti-derivative of the function \\(g(x) = \\frac{x^2}{10000000}\\) This will be \\(G(x) = \\frac{x^3}{30000000}\\).\nEvaluate the anti-derivative at the starting and ending points of the run and subtract: \\[G(1000) - G(500) = \\frac{1000^3}{30000000} - \\frac{500^3}{30000000} = 33.333 - 4.166 = 29.166\\ \\text{cones}\\]\n\nLet’s restate this in terms of some typical quantities involving anti-differentiation:\n\n\\(\\int g(x) dx\\) is just the function \\(G(x)\\), the anti-derivative of \\(g(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\). We can find an anti-derivative using any of the techniques we are studying for doing so. But to remind us that we can add a constant to any anti-derivative of \\(g(x)\\) and still have an anti-derivative, we write down \\(+ C\\).\n\\(\\int_a^b g(x) dx\\) is the total accumulation of \\(g(x)\\) over the interval \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\). In terms of our road-cone example, this is the number of cones picked up between road position \\(x=a\\) and position \\(x=b\\). We will calculate this number using the anti-derivative evaluated at each endpoint: \\[\\int_a^b g(x) dx = G(b) - G(a)\\] We don’t have to worry about the \\(+ C\\) in problem (1) because we know the starting point for accumulation. At point \\(x=a\\) we had accumulated no cones yet. There might have been some cones already on the truck (that is the \\(+ C\\)) but it does not matter because we are looking at the difference in the number or cones on the truck at point \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\), and the already-on-the-truck cones cancel out.\n\\(\\int_a^y g(x) dx\\) can be confusing. We are used to seeing a constant for the upper bound of integration, but here we have a name. It is easier to see what’s going on if we express \\(\\int_a^y g(x)dx\\) in terms of an anti-derivative function \\(G(x)\\): \\[\\int_a^y g(x) dx = G(y) - G(a)\\] This will be a function of \\(y\\). There is no need to put in a \\(+ C\\) because the \\(+ C\\) for the first term will be canceled out when we subtract the \\(+ C\\) in the second term.\n\nForm (3) is asking us to keep track of how many cones have been added to the truck since we left point \\(x=a\\) and reached some other point \\(x=y\\). If we plug in \\(y=b\\), Form (3) turns into Form (2), how many cones were collected between positions \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Form (3) is something like the anti-derivative function. The only difference is that we do not need the \\(+ C\\) because whatever it might be, it gets canceled out in the subtraction.\nSuppose we are asked to calculate yet another quantity:\n\n\\(\\partial_y \\int_a^y g(x) dx\\), the derivative of form (3) with respect to \\(y\\). Again, think of this in terms of the difference of anti-derivatives: \\[\\partial_y \\int_a^y g(x) dx = \\partial_y \\left[G(y) - G(a)\\right] = \\partial_y G(y) - \\partial_y G(a) = \\partial_y G(y) - 0 = g(y)\\]\n\nThe next-to-last step reflects that \\(G(a)\\) is a number of cones, not a function of \\(y\\). The derivative with respect to \\(y\\) of something that is not a function of \\(y\\) is always 0.\n\\(\\partial_y \\int_a^y g(x) dx\\) tells us how fast the cones are accumulating on the truck as we drive along the road. In other words, \\(\\partial_y \\int_a^y g(x) dx\\) has units cones/foot and it is exactly the density of cones (per foot of road) at position \\(y\\), that is, \\(g(y)\\), the density of cones at position \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in draft\n\n\n\nfind-C is an exercise connected to a Shiny app. Re-implement the shiny app using ShinyLive, then include the problem here.\n\n\n33-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

As you recall, we measured the orbit height r from the center of the Earth. Assuming a circular orbit (which is not necessarily a good assumption) the total path length of an orbit is \\(2 \\pi r\\). We also assumed that the acceleration of the satellite due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2 , the value on the Earth’s surface. (And a reasonably good approximation to the value at a height of, say, 100 mi above the surface.)\nThen we asked, how large is the centripetal acceleration needed to keep a satellite in orbit of radius \\(r\\) at velocity \\(v\\). We used dimensional analysis to say that \\(a = v^2/r\\), a formula that is dimensionally consistent. Knowing that \\(a \\approx 9.8\\) m/s^2 , and specifying \\(r = 4050mi\\) (that is, 100 mi above the surface of the Earth), we solved for \\(v\\): \\[v = \\sqrt{a \\times r} = \\sqrt{9.8 \\text{m}\\, \\text{s}^{-2} \\times 4050 \\text{mi}} = 191.5 \\sqrt{\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{mi}\\strut}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\]\n\nWhat is the numerical value of \\(\\sqrt{\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{mi}\\strut}\\) expressed in miles?\n\n\n\n \\(\\sqrt{1609.34 \\text{m}^2} = 40.12 m\\)\n\n\n \\(\\sqrt{40.12 \\text{mi}^2} \\approx 6.33 \\text{mi}\\)\n\n\n \\(\\sqrt{0.000621371 \\text{mi}^2} \\approx 0.025 \\text{mi}\\)\n\n\n It is crazy to take the square root of a length. There is no such thing as \\(\\sqrt{1 m\\strut}\\).\n\n\n\nquestion id: differential-orbit-1\n\n\nUnits aside, consider the formula \\(a = v^2/r\\). It is dimensionally consistent, but how do we know that acceleration isn’t twice or half or some other constant multiple of \\(v^2/r\\)? Now that we have tools from calculus, we can address this issue straight on.\n\nThe figure shows a diagram of the situation. There is a satellite in circular orbit. (Earth hasn’t been included in the diagram.) Annotating one point of the orbit is a vector, \\({\\mathbf v}_1\\), which represents the velocity of the satellite at that point in the orbit. The velocity vector is tangent to the orbit itself; it is instantaneous velocity. One-hundred eighty degrees opposite \\({\\mathbf v}_1\\) is another velocity vector, \\({\\mathbf v}_3\\) that has the same length as \\({\\mathbf v}_1\\) but faces in exactly the opposite direction: \\({\\mathbf v}_3 = -{\\mathbf v}_1\\).\nThe change in the velocity vector over half the orbital time is simple: \\({\\mathbf v}_3 - {\\mathbf v}_1 = {\\mathbf v}_3 + {\\mathbf v}_3 = 2 {\\mathbf v}_3\\).\nNow calculus comes in: the change in velocity is the integral with respect to time of acceleration over the time to complete half an orbit. \\[\\int_{t=\\text{start}}^{t=\\text{end}} {\\mathbf a}\\, dt = 2 {\\mathbf v}_3\\]\nWe can simplify by setting the “start” time to zero. The end time is how long it takes to complete half an orbit. This will be the distance covered divided by the speed. The half circumference of the orbit is \\(\\pi r\\). The speed of the satellite is \\(|v|\\). So the end time is \\(\\pi r/ v\\).\nNow we will take a false step. (You may not see it as such yet, but heads up!) The acceleration is constant: the satellite is always a constant distance from the center of the Earth. That is the nature of circular orbits. So the integral is simple:\n\\[\\int_{t=\\text{start}}^{t=\\text{end}} {\\mathbf a}\\, dt = \\int_{t=0}^{t=\\pi r /v} a\\, dt = a \\int_{t=0}^{t=\\pi r /v} dt = a \\pi r/v = 2v .\\] The rightmost equals relationship comes from our previous analysis of the change in velocity in half an orbit. Solving \\(a \\pi r/v = 2 v\\) we get \\[a = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\frac{v^2}{r} \\neq \\frac{v^2}{r}\\] This half-an-orbit analysis gives a different answer for the relationship between acceleration and velocity than we used in the earlier calculation. At least one of them is wrong.\nWhere is the flaw in reasoning? First, although the magnitude of the acceleration is constant, the acceleration is a vector which is certainly not constant as the satellite moves through the orbit. And, being a vector, we need to keep track of the changing components of the vector. Referring to the diagram, only the “horizontal” component of the acceleration contributes to the change in velocity from point 1 to point 3, because that change is entirely horizontal.\nLook at an intermediate point between 1 and 3. The vector \\({\\mathbf v}_2\\) is shown at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the \\({\\mathbf v}_1\\). At point 2, the acceleration vector is directed (as always) toward the center of the orbit. The horizontal component of the acceleration vector is \\(a \\sin(\\theta)\\), as you can see from the trigonometry of the situation. The previous integral should have been written in terms of the horizontal component of the acceleration:\n\\[\\int_{t=0}^{t=\\pi r/v} |{\\mathbf a}|\\,\\sin(\\theta)\\, dt \\] Keep in mind that \\(\\theta\\) is a function of \\(t\\). The relationship is \\[\\theta = v t / r \\ \\ \\implies\\ \\ \\ d\\theta = \\frac{v}{r}dt\\]\nWe’ve written the differential of the relationship because we will substitute for \\(t\\) and \\(dt\\) to translate the integral to be solely in terms of \\(\\theta\\): \\[\\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta = \\pi} |{\\mathbf a}| \\sin(\\theta)\\frac{r}{v}\\, d \\theta = |{\\mathbf a}| \\frac{r}{v} \\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta = \\pi} \\sin(\\theta)\\, d \\theta\\] The integral involves one of the basic modeling functions, so we’ve memorized the answer.\n\nWhat is \\[\\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta = \\pi} \\sin(\\theta)\\, d \\theta \\ \\text{?}\\]\n\n\n\n 0\n\n\n 2\n\n\n \\(-\\cos(\\theta)\\)\n\n\n \\(- \\pi \\cos(\\theta)\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: differential-orbit-2\n\n\n\nSet \\[|{\\mathbf a}| \\frac{r}{v}\\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta = \\pi} \\sin(\\theta)\\, d \\theta = 2 v\\] and solve for \\(a\\).

But let’s write it as a function of time: \\[\\text{accel}(t) \\equiv -9.8\\] Galileo climbs up to the top of the Tower of Pisa, 56.7 meters above the ground. He is holding a small lead ball between thumb and forefinger. He spreads his fingers and the ball starts to fall from a standstill. How fast will the ball be going as it falls.\nIn this problem, we are given information in the form of acceleration, and want to turn it into a statement about velocity. Remembering that acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, we see this as an anti-derivative problem:\n\\[\\text{vel}(t) \\equiv \\int \\text{accel}(t) dt = \\int -9.8 dt = -\\int 9.8 dt\\] \\[\\text{vel}(t) = -9.8 t + C\\ .\\]\n\nImagine that the time of release was \\(t=3\\) seconds. Remembering that 9.8 is in meters/sec\\(^2\\), what is the value of \\(C\\) in the velocity function?\n\n\n\n 29.4 meters per sec\\(^2\\)\n\n\n 29.4 meters per sec\n\n\n 29.4 meters\n\n\n 29.4 dimensionless/unitless\n\n\n\nquestion id: falling-from-pisa-1\n\n\nWhere will the ball be in 2 seconds after release (that is, at 5 seconds)? “Where” is a position question, so we need to convert the original information that we had in terms of acceleration into information in terms of position.\nWe’ve already used the relationship between acceleration and velocity (acceleration is \\(\\partial_t\\) accel(t)) to compute the velocity vel(t) at any time: vel(t) \\(= -9.8 t + 29.4\\) and we know the units of \\(t\\), \\(-9.8\\) and \\(29.4\\).\nSince velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time, we can compute position as the anti-derivative of velocity: \\[\\text{pos}(t) = \\int \\text{vel}(t) = \\int (29.4-9.8 t) dt\\] \\[\\text{pos}(t) = 29.4 t - 9.8 \\frac{t^2}{2} + C_{pos}\\] Another \\(C\\)! we are writing it as \\(C_{pos}\\) to remind us that this \\(C\\) is different than the \\(C\\) that appeared in the vel(t) function. That \\(C\\) was from the accumulation of acceleration to get velocity. This \\(C_{pos}\\), even though it is the same letter, is something different. Remember that \\(C_{pos}\\) is a reminder that pos(t) is the accumulation of velocity up until time \\(t\\), but we haven’t (yet) specified when the accumulation started. To calculate the \\(C_{pos}\\) for the pos(t) function, we need to consider the problem situation (Galileo in Pisa) and figure out some \\(t_0\\) for which we know \\(pos(t_0)\\).\nWhat we know here is that at the release time (\\(t=3\\) seconds) the ball was at the top of the Tower of Pisa. So dist(3) = 56.7 meters.\n\nWhat’s the value of \\(C_{pos}\\) in the distance function given that dist(3) = 56.7 meters?\n\n\n\n \\(C = 56.7 - 29.4 \\times 3 + 9.8 \\times 3^2 / 2 = 12.6\\) meters\n\n\n \\(C = -29.4 \\times 3 + 9.8 \\times 3^2 / 2 = 44.1\\) meters\n\n\n \\(C = 56.7\\) meters\n\n\n \\(C = 0\\) meters\n\n\n A quantity not in meters.\n\n\n\nquestion id: falling-from-pisa-2\n\n\n\nWhat is the position of the ball two seconds after release?

A textbook problem in ball studies—sorry, “ballistics” is the accepted term—asks how long is the trajectory followed by a ball that travels a horizontal distance D and reaches a maximum height H. Knowing these things about the batted ball—parabola, D, H— is enough to write down the formula for the height of the ball when it passes over position \\(x\\) on the ground: \\[y = \\frac{4H x (D-x)}{D^2}\\]\nWe didn’t ask you to derive the formula, in part because it is only of theoretical interest and not the actual path of a ball in the sky. Nonetheless as a good modeler you should take it apart a bit. Is it a parabola? Is it dimensionally consistent? (\\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(D\\), and \\(H\\) each have dimension L) Does it reach height \\(H\\) at the maximum? (Where is the argmax? What’s the value of the function at the argmax?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how long is the trajectory? This is equivalent to asking how long is the piece of string that would cover the graph of the trajectory. To answer this question from the formula, we do the usual thing of breaking up the problem into smaller bits: that is what the vertical gray lines on the graph are doing. The distance between adjacent lines is \\(dx\\) (10 feet in the graph). Now we ask how long is the trajectory in each segment, then add the results together for all the segments.\nWithin each segment, the trajectory is very close to being a straight line. The run of the line is \\(dx\\), the rise is \\(y'(x) dx\\), where \\(y'\\) is just a concise way of writing \\(\\partial_x y(x)\\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment is \\(\\sqrt( y'^2 dx^2 + dx^2) = \\sqrt{y'^2 + 1}dx\\).\nWe can set up the problem algebraically, as we do in this paragraph, or on the computer, as in Active R chunk 1. For algebra …Plug in the parabolic formula for \\(y\\), the length of each little \\(ds\\) of line segment given \\[ds = \\sqrt{16 \\frac{H^2}{D^4}(D-x)^2 + 1}\\cdot dx\\] Accumulate the many little \\(ds\\) segments, we get \\[S = \\int_{\\text{start}}^{\\text{finish}} ds = \\int_{\\text{start}}^{\\text{finish}}\n\\sqrt{16 \\frac{H^2}{D^4}(D-x)^2 + 1}\\cdot dx\\\\ = \\int_{x=0}^{x=D} \\sqrt{16 \\frac{H^2}{D^4}(D-x)^2 + 1}\\cdot dx\\] We call this “differential modeling” because we are constructing a model of the segment-length differential as a function of \\(x\\). Once we have the model, finding the total trajectory length is “just” a matter of calculating the anti-derivative and evaluating it at the endpoints.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nIt is generally a good idea to check an algebraic solution with a numerical solution. Also, it is a good professional practice to have a way of constructing a simple approximation to the answer. For instance, the trajectory in the graph is very roughly an upside-down V shape. The base of each segment in the V is 155 feet, the height is 200 feet, so the length of the two segments added together is \\(2\\sqrt{155^2 + 200^2} = 506.1\\). We’d expect the length of the actual curve to be a bit longer than this, which it is.\nAnother approximation of the flight of a baseball corresponds better to what is observed visually:\ny &lt;- makeFun(H*sin(pi*(x/D)^2)^(0.5 + x/(2*D)) ~ x, D=310, H=200)\nEssay: Using Active R chunk 1, plot out the new approximation over the domain \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 310\\).

Describe briefly what you think might be more realistic about this approximation and what might be less realistic compared to the parabola model.\n  question id: curve-length-essay \nAgain using Active R chunk 1, compute the length of the curve from \\(0.01 \\leq x \\leq 310\\).

F(x) \\right|_a^u \\ \\ = \\ \\ \\partial_u \\left(F(u) - F(a)\\right) .\\] Let’s look at the right-most expression \\(\\partial_u \\left(F(u) + F(a)\\right)\\) and exploit the the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. So … \\[\\partial_u \\left(F(u) + F(a)\\right) = \\partial_u F(u) - \\partial_u F(a) = \\partial_u F(u)\\]\n\nWhich of the following correctly justifies the step \\[\\partial_u F(u) - \\partial_u F(a) = \\partial_u F(u)\\ \\text{?}\\]\n\n\n\n \\(F(a)\\) is a constant\n\n\n \\(F()\\) is an anti-derivative.\n\n\n \\(F(b)\\) does not appear.\n\n\n \\(F(u) = \\int f(x) dx\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: first-fundamental-theorem-7\n\n\nTaking the left-most and right-most expressions in the above equation, we have \\[\\partial_u \\int_a^u f(x) dx = \\partial_u F(u)\\]\n\nIs there an algebraic simplification of \\(\\partial_u F(u)\\)?\n\n\n\n No, because it depends on what \\(F(u)\\) is.\n\n\n Yes, because \\(\\partial_u F(u)\\) is simply \\(f(u)\\).\n\n\n No, because we could just as easily have written \\(\\partial_x F(x)\\)\n\n\n Yes, because it is the same thing as \\(\\partial_x F(x)\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: first-fundamental-theorem-8\n\n\nThe equation \\[\\partial_u \\int_a^u f(x) dx \\ \\ = \\ \\  f(u)\\] means that “differentiation undoes integration” or, as we’ve been putting it, “differentiation undoes anti-differentiation.”\n\n\nExercise 4 In the 1660s, John Boyle made use of then-new instrumentation to measure gas pressure. He discovered what’s now called Boyle’s Law, which says that, at constant temperature in a closed system, pressure times volume is a constant:\n\\[PV = const\\] In the 1720s, Daniel Fahrenheit developed the first reliable thermometer consisting of a column of mercury in a glass straw. He developed a temperature scale which divided the range from freezing to boiling into 180 small units, which he called “degrees,” as was traditional in measuring angles. (In 1742, Anders Celsius created another scale with freezing at 0 and 100 small units—still called “degrees”—between freezing and boiling.\nWith the availability of reliable thermometers, scientists started to consider the role of temperature in the relationship between pressure and volume. Their many discoveries were eventually synthesized into a “combined gas law” and then into an “ideal gas law” which famously states: \\[PV = nRT .\\] Here, \\(n\\) is “amount” of gas, quantified as the number of moles of the gas in the container, \\(T\\) is temperature, and \\(R\\) is the “ideal gas constant”: \\[R = 8.314  \\text{J}/(\\text{K}\\ \\text{mol})\\] The “mol” cancels out the dimension of \\(n\\), the \\(K\\) cancels out the dimension of \\(T\\), leaving us with \\(PV\\) having the dimension of energy (Joules). The temperature \\(T\\) is measured in degrees Kelvin, which is just like Celsius but moving the location of 0 from freezing to … Well … the hypothetical temperature when \\(PV=0\\), which can be estimated by extrapolating measurements of \\(PV(T)\\) (that is, \\(PV\\) as a function of \\(T\\)) to the \\(T\\) where \\(PV = 0\\).\n\nIt is convenient to have specific units in mind for pressure and volume. Since \\(P V\\) gives energy, let’s arrange \\(P\\) and \\(V\\) to have units such that when multiplied the result is Joules. What is the expression of the dimension Joule in terms of the SI system, that is, time in seconds, length in meters, and mass in kg? Hint: use the above paragraph and knowing that the units for energy are consistent for potential, kinetic, or other types of energy.\n\n\n\n \\(kg  m^2 s^{-2}\\)\n\n\n \\(kg m / s\\)\n\n\n \\(kg^2 m^2 s^3\\)\n\n\n \\(m^2 / s^2\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: PV-units1\n\n\n\nIn the SI units system, volume has units of cubic meters: \\(m^3\\). What are the SI units for pressure in terms of kg, m, and s? The units of your answer to this question times the units for pressure should be equivilent to your answer from the previous question.\n\n\n\n \\(kg m^{-1} s^{-2}\\)\n\n\n \\(kg m^1 s^{-2}\\)\n\n\n \\(kg^2 m^1 s^2\\)\n\n\n \\(m s^2 / kg\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: PV_units2\n\n\nFor use in calculus, it is helpful to re-write the Ideal Gas Law in functional form. There are several ways to do this. For instance, if we wanted to measure the number of moles of gas in a container, we could use the function \\(n(P, V, T) = PV/RT\\). Here, we will focus on pressure as a function of the other quantities: \\[P(n, V, T) = nRT/V.\\] Now consider a very simple machine consisting of a cylinder, closed on one end and sealed by a movable piston at the other, as in this picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Source: R. Castelnuovo - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\n\nThe machine in the picture is more complicated than the simple machine we want to model. The picture includes two small valves at the top of the cylinder connected each to a pipe.\nOur machine has no valves and no pipes. The cylinder is charged with gas when it is manufactured. After that, nothing material goes in or out of the closed cylinder/piston system.\nWhen you push on the cylinder, the volume available for the gas gets smaller and the pressure increases. When you let the cylinder push on you, the volume available gets bigger and the pressure decreases. The amount of gas, \\(n\\), never changes. For simplicity, we will imagine that \\(n=1\\) and that the gas is N\\(_2\\). This means the mass of the gas is 0.028 kg.\nAnd, to simplify even more, let’s insist that the temperature of the cylinder and its gaseous content does not change from room temperature: 293\\(^\\circ\\) Kelvin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you start in a high-volume, low-pressure state and push the piston to move to a low-volume, high-pressure state at the same temperature, you will be putting energy into the machine.\nThe “area” of each little box in the graph, that is, pressure times volume,\n\nHow much energy (in Joules) corresponds to one small rectangle of area in the graph?\n\n\n 500 J        625 J        2500 J        25,000 J       \n\nquestion id: PV3\n\n\n\nBy counting rectangles in the graph, estimate how much energy needs to be put into the machine when the volume changes from 7.5 m\\(^3\\) to 2.5 m\\(^3\\) at a temperature of 300 K?\n\n\n 1000 J        3000 J        5000 J        10,000 J       \n\nquestion id: PV4\n\n\nNow that you have compressed the gas in the cylinder, by doing work on it, let’s heat up the machine to 1200K.\n\nWhat will be the pressure of the gas when the volume of the machine is 2.5 m\\(^3\\) at temperature 1200 K?

Such a machine is called a “heat engine” since it turns a source of high temperature and a source of low temperature into energy.\nEvaluate the code in Active R chunk 1. The first line defines a function \\(P(V, T)\\) with default \\(n=1\\) mole of gas. Anti-differentiate \\(P()\\) with respect to \\(V\\) then calculate the energy needed to compress the cylinder at the low temperature, that is \\[\\int_{7.5}^{2.5} P(V, T=300) dV .\\] Call this numerical result compress_energy.\nSimilarly, calculate the energy done by the machine in the high-temperature expansion \\[\\int_{2.5}^{7.5} P(V, T=1200) dV .\\] Call this numerical result expand_energy.\nYou may want to make a graph of your \\(P(V, T)\\) function to check that it is right. Also, check that the integrals are right by comparing them to the rough estimate you made earlier by counting squares.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 The function windspeed(t) records wind speed at the site of a wind-turbine farm over one day, that is, \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 24\\) hours. The function speed2power(s) is the production function for the model of wind turbine used at the farm: the input is speed in miles per hour, the output is in kilowatts. (Both these functions were created for this exercise. They are not about a real turbine at a real wind farm, but are somewhat realistic.) Hint: you can nest a function inside of another function. For instance, if I had a function (‘solarpanelpower’) that calculates the amount of power a solar panel generates and another function (‘sunlight’) that tells me the amount of sunlight at time of the day (‘TOD’). I could evaluate this in one step like the following: ‘solarpanelpower(sunlight(TOD))’. This would give me the amount of power from the solar panel based upon the time of the day.\nYour task, find the total energy generated over the 24-hour period by the turbine. Reminder: energy \\(E\\) is electric power multiplied by time. Or, more usefully for this problem, the increment energy \\(dE\\) generated at time \\(t\\) is the product of power at time \\(t\\) multiplied by the increment of time \\(dt\\), that is, \\(dE = p(t) dt\\). Consequently, \\[E = \\int_\\text{morning}^\\text{night} p(t) dt\\] where “morning” should really be 00:00 h and night 24:00 h on the day in question.\nWe don’t have an algebraic formula for windspeed(t) even though it is a function. You can use antiD() to find the anti-derivative of the electric power function.\nThe answer you compute should be saved to the name result. The units will be in kWh – kilowatt hours.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWind turbines of this type have a maximum power rating of 5000 kilowatts.

In sunshine, these generate power. You use some of that power immediately for cooking, lighting, and such. Any power generated above your needs gets stored in a battery. Any power used above the solar generation gets supplied by the battery.\nOver the course of a day, your use of power fluctuates (you use the toaster, open the refrigerator, etc). Similarly, the solar generation fluctuates as clouds pass by and the sun rises and sets in the sky. The amount of energy stored in the battery fluctuates over the day as you consume energy in your home and produce it with the solar panels.\nThe unit used for electrical power is a “kilowatt” (kW). An old-fashioned incandescent light bulb consumes about 0.1 kW while lighted, a modern LED bulb generates about the same amount of light using only 0.01 kW. A refrigerator uses about 0.1 kW while a hair-dryer uses about 1 kW when it is running.\nBatteries store energy. The usual unit for energy is “kilowatt-hour” (kWh). A refrigerator will, over a 24-hour day, use 0.1 * 24 = 2.4 kWh. Power multiplied by time duration gives energy. If the power were constant, the energy could be calculated by a simple multiplication of the power over the duration. Since power fluctuates, we cannot do the calculation with ordinary multiplication. Instead, we have to integrate power over time.\nFor this activity, use the “Solar-panels” App.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in draft\n\n\n\nConvert the App to ShinyLive and embed here.\n\n\n\nWhy is it called “net production” instead of just “production?”\n\n\n\n Because your house is connected to the utility electrical network in case you need extra power.\n\n\n Because the system designer is something of a poet and wants you to think of the solar cells as a kind of fishing net harvesting photons.\n\n\n Because the government will send you surplus hair nets to thank you for reducing CO2 production.\n\n\n Because it is not simply production from the solar panels but production minus consumption (the solar panels require energy to run). If you ignored consumption, you would call it “gross energy produced.”\n\n\n\nquestion id: panda-tear-cotton-1\n\n\n\nThe bottom graph shows energy accumulated in the battery since midnight. What does it mean that the energy accumulated is negative?\n\n\n\n The battery level is lower throughout the day than it was at midnight.\n\n\n The battery is discharging over the entire day.\n\n\n The sign is not important.\n\n\n\nquestion id: panda-tear-cotton-2\n\n\n\nDuring the interval from 05:00 to 20:00, how much did the energy stored by the battery change? Highlight that interval in the beeps graph.\n\n\n -2.5 kWh        1.9 kW        15 hours        1.5 kWh       \n\nquestion id: panda-tear-cotton-3\n\n\n\nSuppose the battery was holding 20 kWh at 00:00. How much energy was it holding at 15:00?\n\n\n -2 kWh        18 kWh        20 kWh        24 kWh       \n\nquestion id: panda-tear-cotton-4\n\n\n\nWhen you choose a time interval in the beep graph, how come the energy stored (in kWh) is displayed as an area in the top graph? Keep in mind that the vertical scale of the top graph is kW, not kWh.\n\n\n\n It is pretty.\n\n\n To highlight visually the interval that was selected.\n\n\n To convert kW to kWh, we are effectively multiplying the power (kW) by the time duration. Power is on the vertical axis, time duration is on the horizontal axis. Multiplying the two corresponds to the area under the graph.\n\n\n\nquestion id: panda-tear-cotton-5\n\n\n\nHow come two different colors are used to display the “area” under the net power curve?\n\n\n\n The second derivative of the anti-derivative of \\(f(t)\\) is equal to \\(f(t)\\).\n\n\n No reason related to calculus per se. We like to make graphs pretty.\n\n\n Because it is not simply “area.” it is the product of net power and time duration, and sometimes this quantity is negative. The color indicates whether the quantity is positive or negative at any instant.\n\n\n\nquestion id: panda-tear-cotton-6\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8 Suppose the continuous function \\(f(x)\\) is positive on \\(x \\in [0, 4]\\) and negative on \\(x \\in [4, 8]\\).

Suppose the dimension of the output of a function \\(v(t)\\) is \\(L/T\\), for instance, meters-per-second.\nThe anti-derivative function \\(V(t) \\equiv \\int v(t) dt\\) will also have dimension and units.\nRecall that in constructing the anti-derivative using the Euler method, we multiply the values of \\(v(t)\\) times some small increment in the input, \\(h\\). Therefore the dimension of the output of \\(V(t)\\) will be \\([v(t)] [t]\\). So if \\([v(t)] = L/T\\), the dimension \\([V(t)] [t] = L T/T = L\\). Units for such a dimension would be, for instance, meters. This makes sense, since if you accumulate velocity (meters-per-sec) over an interval of time (sec) you end up with the distance travelled (meters).\nSuppose you know the acceleration \\(a(t)\\) of an object as a function of time.

For instance, Active R chunk 1 shows the graph of the natural logarithm function over the domain \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 21\\).\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nThe command in the sandbox is a little different than the usual slice_plot(). We’ve added on two things:\n\nAn argument npts=11 which says to use 11 discrete values of the input in plotting the graph.\nA second graphics layer that shows a dot at each input point where slice_plot() evaluated the function. Behind the seemingly smooth curves that slice_plot() produces is really a discrete set of points each of which is the output of the function at some numerical input.\n\nIn our typical use of slice_plot() we leave out the dots and show only the straight line segments that connect the positions where the dots would be plotted. If the positions are spaced closely enough, your eye will not see the joints between successive straight lines and you will perceive the graph as a smooth curve.\n\nFor the graph of the log function over the domain \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 21\\) with npts=11 (that is, the initial command shown in the sandbox), what is the horizontal spacing between the discrete \\(x\\) values?\n\n\n 1        2        4        5       \n\nquestion id: slicedots1\n\n\nNow take away the npts= argument.

So let’s look at some basic R functions for implementing the Euler Method when we know the function to be anti-differentiated \\(f(x)\\), the step size \\(h\\), and the domain \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\). At the heart of the implementation is a function cumsum(), the “cumulative sum.” This does something very simple. The cumulative sum of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 is another sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10.\nActive R chunk 2 has commands for using cumsum() to approximate the anti-derivative of a function \\(f()\\) over the domain \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\).\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2:   question id: falcon-hurt-pot-essay \n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere is a function:\n\ng &lt;- makeFun(exp(-0.2*(x^2))~x)\n\nUse Active R chunk 2 to find and plot the anti-derivative of \\(g(x)\\) over the domain \\(-6 \\leq x \\leq 6\\).\nYour task: Describe the shape of \\(G(x)\\).

Your friend, in the bow of the boat, uses a radar gun to record velocity at each instant. Velocity is, of course, the change in position over time. The recording lasts for 12 minutes, that is 0.20 hour, as shown in the Sailing-over-time app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in draft\n\n\n\nEmbed the sailing over time app here using ShinyLive.\n\n\nHow far did the boat travel during the 0.2-hour recording? Distance equals velocity times time. If the velocity were constant, say 4 mph, the distance would be 4 mph \\(\\times\\) 0.2 hour \\(= 0.8\\) miles. But the velocity is changing over the recording. To do the velocity-times-time calculation we use the standard calculus method of dividing up time into a series of very short time intervals, each of duration \\(dt\\). Over each of these short time intervals, the boat travels a short distance. For instance, for the interval covering time \\(t = 0.05\\) hour, the boat travels distance \\(\\text{vel}(0.05) dt\\).\nSuppose we set \\(dt = 0.05\\) hour. There would be 5 such 0.05-hour-long intervals over the entire 0.2-hour recording, shown as colored segments in the graph. In the first interval, the boat has velocity that we will approximate as \\(\\text{vel}(0)\\) and travels roughly \\(\\text{vel}(0) dt\\). During the second 0.05-hour-long interval, the boat’s velocity is \\(\\text{vel}(0.05)\\) and travels \\(\\text{vel}(0.05) dt\\). During the third interval, the velocity is \\(\\text{vel}(0.15)\\) and travels \\(\\text{vel}(0.15) dt\\). The total distance travelled is \\[\\text{vel}(0.00)dt + \\text{vel}(0.05)dt + \\text{vel}(0.10)dt + \\ldots + \\text{vel}(0.15)dt = \\] \\[\\left[\\text{vel}(0.00) + \\text{vel}(0.05) + \\text{vel}(0.10) + \\ldots + \\text{vel}(0.15)\\right] dt = \\]\n\\[14.01\\ \\text{miles/hour} \\times 0.05\\   \\text{hour}\\]\nEach of the terms like \\(\\text{vel}(0.10) dt\\) is a velocity times a duration of time. This multiplies a quantity on the horizontal axis by a quantity on the vertical axis. Graphically, such a multiplication can be shown as an “area.” But keep in mind that the units of this “area” are miles. (Vertical axis: miles-per-hour. Horizontal axis: hours. Multiply the two quantities: hours \\(\\times\\) miles/hour = miles.)\nIf you have changed the length of dt and/or clicked show the multiplication as an area, You can scroll up and see the changes to the graph.\nThe sum above amounts to adding up all those rectangular “areas,” each of which is in the units “miles.”\n\nWhat is the dimension of the quantity \\(14.01\\ \\text{miles/hour} \\times 0.05  \\text{hour}\\)?\n\n\n\n LT^2\n\n\n L\n\n\n L/T\n\n\n T\n\n\n T/L\n\n\n\nquestion id: sailing-over-time-1\n\n\nMaking dt small\nAnother way to write the formula given in the previous section uses the mathematical “sum” symbol: \\[\\text{vel}(0.00)dt + \\text{vel}(0.05)dt + \\text{vel}(0.10)dt + \\ldots + \\text{vel}(0.15)dt = \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\text{vel}(t_i) dt\\] The \\(t_i\\) in \\(\\sum \\text{vel}(t_i)\\) is a notation for the horizontal location of the \\(i^{th}\\) segment. Since the length of each segment is 0.05 hour in this example, \\(t_i\\) is \\(i \\times 0.05\\).\nUsing the sum notation, we can easily write down the calculation if we set \\(dt\\) to be 0.01 hour rather than 0.05 hour in which case will have 20 segments covering the 0.2 hours of the recording: \\[\\sum_{\\text{i}=0}^{19} \\text{vel}(t_i) dt\\] Or, with \\(dt\\) set to one-thousandth of an hour there will be 200 segments: \\[\\sum_{\\text{i}=0}^{199} \\text{vel}(t_i) dt\\] Evaluate the commands in Active R chunk 3 to calculate the first two of the sum formulas with \\(dt = 0.01\\) hour and \\(dt = 0.001\\) hour respectivly.

What is \\[\\sum_{i = 0}^{19999} \\text{vel}(t_i = 0.00001 \\times i) dt\\ \\ \\text{?}\\]\n\n\n 0.7816        0.7843        0.7886        0.7889       \n\nquestion id: sailing-over-time-3\n\n\nYou can see that for \\(dt \\lessapprox 0.01\\), the answer does not depend much on \\(dt\\). In fact, the radar gun will round off the velocity to the nearest 1/10 mph, so any real accuracy by taking \\(dt\\) very small is illusory.\nYou can also see that the calculations themselves are a bit finicky. You have to get the number of segments to correspond to the choice of \\(dt\\) and convert the segment id number to time properly. Then you add in something of size \\(dt/2\\) to be in the middle of the segment.\nTo save all this trouble in accumulating the velocity or any other change function, we simply say, “Integrate the function \\(\\text{vel}(t)\\) over the interval \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 0.2\\).” In symbols, we write this \\[\\int_0^{0.2} \\text{vel}(t) dt\\] meaning “sum from time \\(t=0\\) until time \\(t=0.2\\).”\nThe anti-derivative of \\(\\text{vel}(t)\\), which we can write \\(\\text{VEL}(t)\\), tells the sum of the \\(\\text{vel}(t)\\ dt\\) segments. Plug in a numerical value for that argument and out will come a numerical value for \\(\\text{VEL}()\\) at that input. The one argument of \\(\\text{VEL}(t)\\) is the end time of the accumulation.\nThere is no explicit mention of the start time. To indicate that \\(\\text{VEL}(t)\\) does not tell the start time of accumulation, we write the anti-derivative generally as \\(\\text{VEL}(t) + C\\). The \\(C\\) is unknown because the start time is unknown.\nOnce we know a start time, we can figure out \\(C\\). Suppose the start time is \\(0\\). And let’s make, for the sake of argument, the end time be \\(t=0\\) as well. Common sense tells us that when the start time and the end time are the same, nothing gets accumulated. Thus, whatever \\(C\\) might be, \\(\\text{VEL}(0) + C = 0\\), giving us \\(C = -\\text{VEL}(0)\\).\nNow suppose we want to know how much is accumulated over the interval \\(3 \\leq t \\leq 8\\). The start time is 3, so the relevant choice of \\(C\\) is \\(C = -\\text{VEL}(3)\\).\nNow, evaluate the anti-derivative at the end time, 8. The amount accumulated to time 8 is \\(\\text{VEL}(8) + C\\). But we now know \\(C\\) and can re-write the amount accumulated in the interval \\(3 \\leq t \\leq 8\\) as \\(\\text{VEL}(8) - \\text{VEL}(3)\\).\nIn general, if \\(F(x)\\) is the anti-derivative of \\(f(x)\\) then the accumulation of \\(f(x)\\) over the interval \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\) will be \\[\\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\\]\nNote that, because we specified the start at \\(x=a\\), we do not have to include the constant \\(C\\). In a way, \\(C\\) is just a reminder that \\(F(x)\\) tells us the accumulation up to \\(x\\), but without our knowing where the accumulation started.\nThe anti-derivative lets us split accumulation problems into two pieces:\n\nFind the anti-derivative \\(F(x)\\) of \\(f(x)\\), the quantity being accumulated.\nWhen we want to know the amount accumulated over any specified interval \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\), simply plug in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), like this: \\(F(b) - F(a)\\).\n\nWe can use any technique we like to find the anti-derivative \\(F(x)\\). When \\(f(x)\\) is one of our basic modeling functions with a linear interior function (e.g. \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\)), we can always write down the formula for the anti-derivative using the rules we have studied (e.g. \\(F(x) = \\frac{1}{k} e^{kx}\\)). Or, if we have a formula for \\(f(x)\\) that is more difficult, we can look for a solution that someone else has figured out. But, often, there will be no simple formula for \\(F(x)\\). In that case, we can use numerical methods like the sum-of-segments we used to find the distance sailed.\nThe antiD() R operator takes as input a tilde expression defining the function \\(f()\\), e.g. exp(k*x) ~ x. As an output, it produces a function \\(F(x)\\). Let’s try:\nUse the sandbox and the antiD() function to accumulate the boat’s velocity over the interval from \\(t=0.0\\) to \\(0.2\\).\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 4\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nAntiD as notation for Euler\nAt minute 4:26 (that is, hour 0.0710), the boat sailed by a red marker buoy. Then at minute 6:45 (that is, hour 0.1075), the boat passed a blue marker bouy. How far apart are the red and blue bouys?\nThis is an accumulation problem that we can denote as \\[\\int_{0.0710}^{0.1075} \\text{vel}(t) dt .\\] Use the anti-derivative \\(\\text{VEL}(t)\\) computed in the earlier sandbox to calculate the accumulated velocity times \\(dt\\).\n\nWhich is the correct answer over the interval?\n\n\n\n 0.154 hours\n\n\n 0.154 meters\n\n\n 0.7889 hours\n\n\n 0.154 miles\n\n\n 0.7889 miles\n\n\n\nquestion id: sailing-over-time-4\n\n\n\n37-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

Being hungry (and knowing the shortest path between two points on the plane!), the tortoise takes off in a straight line for the lettuce. She pretty quickly reaches her top speed, but then starts to tire. If her velocity as a function of time (in meters per minute) is modeled by \\(v(t) = 7 t e^{-0.3t}\\), how long does it take the tortoise to reach her lunch? Answer this question by finding an calculus/algebra formula for the tortoise’s displacement and then use it to approximate how long it takes to get to the lettuce.\nWe will be looking at \\(\\int v(t) dt = 7 \\int t e^{-0.3 t} dt\\).\nWe will call the left side of the equation “displacement(t)”. Use integration by parts to find displacement(t) as a simple formula in \\(t\\).\nThe tortoise will reach the cabbage at time \\(t^\\star\\) such that \\(\\text{displacement}(t^\\star) = 65\\) meters. Use Active R chunk 2 to graph your displacement function to find \\(t^\\star\\). Remember that there will be a constant of integration which can be found by noting that \\(\\text{displacement}(0) = 0\\).

This poses no fundamental problem to the construction of the anti-derivative, particularly when a computer is available to handle the book-keeping of numerical integration.\nStill, it is convenient to have an algebraic form when it can be found. Many people have devoted considerable effort to constructing extensive collections of functions for which an algebraic form of anti-derivative is known. Think of such collections as a gallery of portraits of people who happen to have red hair. No matter how large the collection, you will often have to deal people who are not redheads. And unlike real redheads, it can be hard to know whether a function has an anti-derivative that can be expressed simply in algebraic form. For instance, \\(f(x) \\equiv \\exp(-x^2)\\) does not, even though it is ubiquitous in fields such as statistics.\nSo, how to organize the gallery of redheads? Let’s take a field trip to the NIST DLMF (The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been a primary publisher for more than 50 years of information about functions encountered in applied mathematics. The work, published originally in book form, is also available via the internet as the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions!\nWarning! Many visitors to NIST DLMF encounter dizziness, fatigue, and anxiety. Should you experience such symptoms, close your eyes and remember that DLMF is a reference work and that you will not be examined on its use. Nonetheless, to help you benefit maximally from the field trip, there are a few questions in this Daily Digital for you to answer from DLMF.\nYou should also note that the techniques in almost universal use to help you navigate through voluminous collections of data (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) such as ratings, subscribing, “friending,” following, etc. are entirely absent from DLMF. There is not even a friendly introduction to each chapter saying who the material might be of interest to.\nWe will focus on Chapter 4, “Elementary Functions,” and indeed just a few sections from that chapter. (A better name for the chapter would be “The Functions Most Often Used.” They are not “elementary” as in “elementary school” but as in the “periodic table of elements.”)\nSection 4.10 covers integrals and anti-derivatives of logarithmic, exponential and power-law functions.\nSection 4.26 is similar, but for trigonometric functions.\n\nNavigate to equation 4.10.1. This is one of the anti-derivatives you are expected to know by heart in CalcZ.\n\nNotice that the input name \\(z\\) is used. They could have selected any other name; \\(x\\) and \\(t\\) are popular, \\(y\\) less so, and \\(\\xi\\) even less so. The use of \\(z\\) is a signal to the cognoscenti that the function can be applied to both real and complex numbers.\nLook at equation 4.10.8. This is another of the functions whose anti-derivative you should know by heart.\nPerhaps it would have avoided some confusion if 4.10.1 had been written in terms of \\[\\int \\frac{1}{az}dz\\] so that you would know what to do if you had encountered such a function.\n\n\nSome exercises:\n\nWhich of these is \\(\\int \\frac{1}{az}dz\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(\\frac{1}{a} \\ln(z)\\)\n\n\n There is no anti-derivative of \\(1/az\\).\n\n\n \\(a \\ln(z)\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: wolf-come-room-1\n\n\n\nUse Section 4.10 of DLMF to find \\(\\int \\frac{1}{e^{3 t} + 5}dt\\)\n\n\n\n \\(\\frac{1}{15}(3t - \\ln(e^{3t} + 5))\\)\n\n\n There is no such function listed in Section 4.10.\n\n\n \\(\\frac{1}{15}(5 t - \\ln(e^{5t} + 3))\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: wolf-come-room-2\n\n\n\nIs \\(\\frac{1}{e^{az} + b}\\) different from \\(e^{-(az + b)}\\)?\n\n\n\n Yes\n\n\n No\n\n\n Depends on the value of \\(b\\).\n\n\n\nquestion id: wolf-come-room-3\n\n\n\nUsing section 4.26, find \\(\\int \\tan(\\theta) d\\theta\\).\n\n\n\n \\(-\\ln\\left(\\strut\\cos(\\theta)\\right)\\)\n\n\n \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\) does not have an anti-derivative.\n\n\n There is no \\(\\theta\\) in section 4.26\n\n\n\nquestion id: wolf-come-room-4\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 15 Using integration by parts, show that \\[\\int x^2 \\, e^{-x}\\, dx = e^{-x} \\left(2 - 2 x - x^2\\right)\\] Hint: The 2’s in \\(2 - 2x - x^2\\) are a hint that you don’t need to integrate \\(x^2\\).\nShow your work.\n\n\nExercise 16 The integral \\[\\int x \\sin(x) dx = -x \\cos(x) + \\sin(x) + C\\ .\\]\nConfirm this result by differentiating both side of the above equation.\nAs well, use the given result to figure out what was the choice of \\(u(x)\\) and \\(v'(x)dx\\) when \\(\\int x \\sin(x) dx\\) was integrated by parts.\nShow your work.\n\n\nExercise 17 Use integration by parts to find \\[\\int x^2 \\ln(x) dx\\ .\\] Show your choices of \\(u(x)\\) and \\(v'(x) dx\\).\n\n\nExercise 18 Use integration by parts to find \\(\\int \\ln(x) dx\\).

The instrumentation includes an odometer (measuring distance, in miles), a speedometer (measuring speed, in miles/hour), and a fuel-economy readout that give you more or less instantaneous miles per gallon. It also has a compass to give your instantaneous heading.\nCurious about whether the instantaneous fuel-economy reading is accurate, you’ve hooked up your Daily-Digital™ Easy-Data-Recorder© to the car’s digital port and set it to record speed (speed()), fuel-economy (mpg()), heading (heading()), and incline (slope()). You set out on your trip, your friend turns on the Daily-Digital™ Easy-Data-Recorder© and you record for 1 hour.\nAfter you reach your destination, you download the recording, which is in the form of R functions (see names above) which take time in minutes as an input and return respectively miles-per-hour, miles-per-gallon, heading in degrees (with 0 being North), and incline in degrees.\nHere are graphs of the recorded functions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA first step in working with data is to make sure the data are what you think they are. (If you’re wrong about this, it’s hardly likely that your interpretation will be correct!) Answer the following questions, which should only take a few minutes. No detailed calculations are necessary at this stage.\nQuestion A. Notice that all four of the graphs have time on the horizontal axis. Explain briefly why this is appropriate to the way the data were collected.\nQuestion B. In your head, for each quantity displayed on the vertical axis, construct a constant function of time that corresponds roughly to the data as plotted. That function would graph as a horizontal line. The vertical position of the horizontal line should be “in the middle” of the values taken on by the actual data. For each graph, pick a reasonable numerical value, giving units. You should be able to do this with a glance at the graph and the vertical axis scale. Rough values will do.\nQuestion C. Referring to the values you selected for Question B, explain briefly what the values and their units mean, e.g. on average how fast the car is going, what direction (e.g. northwest) is the car traveling, whether the overall trip is mostly uphill or downhill, how far the car can travel on a gallon of gasoline.\nQuestion D. Pick two of the quantities—your choice—that appear to be related to one another and describe that relationship in everyday English.\n\nNow we turn to questions that are to be answered quantitatively, using the tools of calculus and mathematics generally. The “raw materials” you will work with are the functions functions speed(t), mpg(t), slope(t), and heading(t) Each question can be approached in a similar way:\n\nChoose or construct a function that gives an “instantaneous” value for an appropriate quantity. For instance, the heading() function gives the instantaneous direction that the car is pointing at each instant of time.\n\nDepending on the question, you might be able to use one of the “raw-material” functions directly, or you might need to combine two or more of the functions by multiplication, division, or use of a trigonometric function such as sin() or cos(). When you use such a combination, it’s a good practice to give an explicit name to the function. For instance—and this is a silly, utterly meaningless combination used just for the example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nConstruct the anti-derivative of the function in (i). You can do this with antiD(), no creative thought is needed for this step.\nUse the anti-derivative function from (ii) in some way that will answer the question. For instance, using the anti-derivative to evaluate a “definite integral” may be appropriate in some cases. Graphing the anti-derivative as a function of time may be appropriate in other cases.\n\nFor each of the four quantitative questions you will\n\nMake the quantitative calculation, getting a numerical result in each case. In addition to running your computer code, you will copy and paste that code into the appropriate space on the submission form. Only the code in the box needs to be submitted, not the graphical or other outputs.\nCopy the numerical value in the output from (a) into the appropriate space on the submission form. The units of the value are specified in the question statement.\nGive a brief English-language justification for the instantaneous function you used or constructed in your answer and what justifies your using/evaluating/plotting the anti-derivative of that function in the way you did. (Silly example to illustrate the form: “The ultimate answer should be a volume in cubic meters. So the instantaneous function rate_of_volume(t) should have an output in cubic meters per second. I can get this by multiplying the area(t) function and the speed(t) function. I graphed the anti-derivative of rate_of_volume(t) to look for the time at which it crosses zero.”)\n\nGeneral Hints:\n\nYou will need to pay careful attention to units, especially that time is in minutes while speed is in miles-per-hour.\nYou will have to combine the miles-per-hour function and the miles-per-gallon function in order to produce a new function that is gallons-per-hour. You can integrate that new function to find the fuel usage. Be thoughtful about whether you need miles-per-gallon or its reciprocal, gallons-per-mile.\nThe heading(t) function gives direction in degrees from north in the standard way for navigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A compass. Note that the compass pictured leaves the last zero off the degree reading. What’s marked as 24 is really 240 degrees.\n\n\n\nThe east-west component of this direction is sin(heading(t)*pi/180); the north-south component is cos(heading(t)*pi/180). The pi/180 factor converts the unit “degrees” into the unit “radians” so that they will make sense as inputs to the sin() and cos() functions. 4) A mile is 5280 feet or 1609.34 meters. There are—as you are well aware—60 minutes in an hour and 3600 seconds in an hour. 5) Even if you don’t drive, you likely know something about how far a car can travel in an hour or how much fuel is used during that time. You also know about altitudes in the mountains. If the mathematics gives you an answer that is crazy big or crazy small, check the units. You might have forgotten to convert them to the units asked for in the question. Example: If you integrate miles/hour with respect to minutes, what you get is miles (minutes/hour). That quantity has dimension L, but the units miles (minutes/hour) are not the same as miles.\nQuantitative Question 1: How far did you travel? (Answer: units in miles)\n\nYour answer should have three components: a. your R code b. the numerical answer c. a brief explanation of your reasoning\n  question id: fuel-narrative-essay-1 \nQuantitative Question 2: The end-destination was how far north of the departure point?

Arrange that new tab side-by-side with the one where you are reading this.\nTo solve a differential equation with the Euler method, you need two things:\n\nThe differential equation itself. Several choices are available in the selector on the left side of the app. On the right side of the equation is the dynamics(x) function.\nAn initial condition \\(x(0)\\). You can select this with the slider.\n\nYou will also need\n\nA stepsize \\(h\\). So long as this is “small enough,” the specifics don’t really matter.\n\nHow Euler works The first row of the table shows the situation at \\(t=0\\). At that time, the value of \\(x\\), that is \\(x(t=0)\\) is the initial condition that you set with the slider.\nIn the following, whenever we write \\(x(t)\\) we mean \\(x\\) at the time in the last row of the table.\n\nKnowing the value of \\(x(t)\\) the instantaneous value of \\(\\partial_t x\\) can be found by plugging \\(x(t)\\) into the dynamics() function.\nNow that we know \\(\\partial_t x\\), we know how fast \\(x\\) is changing. Multiply this rate of change by \\(h\\) to get the total change of \\(x\\) for the next step.\nAdd a new row to the table at \\(t+h\\) with the \\(x\\)-value from the previous row added to the total change of \\(x\\) from that previous row.

Another good way to quantify this is the decimal place at which the calculated solutions differ.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe approximation error occurs after the seventh decimal place.\nA.

(This means you should set use the arguments bounds(t=0:50), dt=0.01. Call your trajectory T1.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nBased on your results in (3), what are the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) at time \\(t=50\\).\nMake a time series plot of \\(x(t)\\). Note that \\(x(t)\\) jumps between a oscillation with negative \\(x\\) and the same kind of oscillation with positive \\(x\\).\nPlot out the \\(y\\) component of the trajectory versus the \\(x\\) component of the trajectory. To get a smooth plot, you will have to use the npts=10000 argument to traj_plot(). The trajectory will appear to cross itself, but this is because you are only plotting two of the state variables.\nCreate another trajectory T2 in the same way you made T1. But change each of the initial conditions in the third decimal point. Then plot out the \\(x(t)\\) time series for T1 (with color=\"blue\") and the \\(x(t)\\) time series for T2 (with color=“red”`) on the same axes. The two time series will track one another very closely, but then come out of sync with one another.\nThe characteristic feature of chaos is that a small change in initial conditions can lead to a very large change in the time series. How long does it take for the two time series in (7) to become utterly out of sync with one another?\nThe function traj_plot_3D() provides a simple way to look at the trajectory in 3 dimensions. Such a plot shows that the trajectory does not in fact cross itself.

To illustrate, consider the differential equation \\[\\partial_t x = a x^2\\ .\\]\nThis can be interpreted in terms of a model of the size of the flame as one lights a match. Think of the flame as a ball of hot gas of radius \\(x\\); the gas include oxygen (O_2_), nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, as well as a vapor of the combustible material such as the potassium chlorate of the match head.\nWithin the ball of flame, O_2_ reacts with the cumbustible material to produce the products of combustion and heat. Needless to say, this reaction eliminates the O_2_ in the ball. But O_2_ can diffuse into the ball from outside. The O_2_ infusion rate available in this way is proportional to the surface area of the ball, that is, \\(a x^2\\). Thus the differential equation models the growth of the flame ball.\nThe match-flame equation is one that can be separated into parts: all the \\(x\\) components on one side, the \\(t\\) on the other. That is: \\[\\underbrace{\\frac{dx}{dt} = a x^2}_{\\text{original DE}}\\ \\ \\ \\implies \\underbrace{\\frac{dx}{x^2} = a dt}_{\\text{separated DE}}\\]\nIntegrating both sides of the separated equation will produce \\(a t + C\\) on the right side.\nA. Integrate the left side of the separated equation and use that to find a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(a t + C\\).\nB. The constant of integration, \\(C\\), will reflect the initial condition. Plug in \\(t=0\\) and calculate from the relationship in (A) what is \\(C\\) in terms of \\(x_0\\).\nC. Replace \\(C\\) in your relationship with the expression in terms of \\(x_0\\) you found in (B). Confirm that this is \\[x(t) = \\frac{1}{a t - 1/x_0}\\ .\\]\nD. \\(x(t)\\) has a vertical asymptote. Find it.\nE. Use integrateODE() to integrate the original differential equation. You will have to pick some numerical value for \\(a\\) and \\(x_0\\). Take care to make \\(dt\\) small enough. You will know that \\(dt\\) is small enough when you get the approximately same solution using \\(dt/10\\).\nF. Describe in everyday words what the solution says and how big the ball of flame becomes.\nThe model \\(\\partial_t x = a x^2\\), like all models, includes some features of the real-world system and excludes others. In this case, once the ball reaches a critical diameter, there is no longer enough combustion product to continue the reaction at the rate depicted in the model. If you watch a match being lit, you will see both the explosion and the eventual exhaustion of the combustion material.\n\n40-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

We will imagine that the state space is represented by a road, the instantaneous state being the location of a car along that road.\nOn a real road, the motion of the car is set by the driver using the accelerator and brakes and constrained by other traffic and road conditions. In our state-space road, the velocity of the car is strictly dictated by an authoritarian government law: no exceptions. When the dictated speed is zero, the car will stand still and cannot start moving again. Ultimately, depending on the shape of the law, the car will head off to infinity or come to an eternal standstill. Two different cars can never collide on this road: if the cars are close together, they must be traveling at similar velocities. Cars cannot pass one another in different directions. Passing requires that the two cars have opposite velocities: one positive and one negative. If the mandated velocity at a point along the road is positive, every car that comes to that point must have the same positive velocity as it passes that point in the road.\nThe diagram in Figure @ref(fig:road-rules) shows one possible format for describing the regulations for a road. The road is shown as a grey line. The red numbers are mile-markers alongside the road. The function graph shows the mandated speed at any point: you can read off the numerical value of the mandated speed on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better visualize the flow of traffic on the road, in Figure @ref(fig:road-flow) we draw vectors on the road. The direction of each vector will be either east or west; the length of the vector gives the required speed for a car passing that point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The mandatory speed on the road.\n\n\n\nCars arriving from the west are obliged to stop their journey at about \\(x=4\\) where the arrows switch direction. Similarly, cars arriving from the east will be driving west, but their journey has a different destination, mile 13, where the velocity regulations change direction. The easterners will be obliged to stop at the point where the left-facing arrows meet the right-facing ones. A car starting near mile 10 will be obliged to drive east but can go only to mile 13; a car starting at mile 7 will drive west until reaching mile 4.\nThis is a lot of detail in the shape of the dynamical function—I mean, the road regulations. So far as the consequences of the road regulations go, the situation is simpler: cars standing still at mile 4 or at mile 13, depending on where they started from.\nZooming in on the dynamics near mile 4 or 13 helps to show what happens as the cars approach those points. (Figure @ref(fig:road-flow-zoom)) At either point, the action is similar. Cars coming from the west have to slow down as the arrows get smaller. Similarly for cars from the east. Where east meets west the cars are forced to a standstill; in order for the vectors to have different directions on the west end of the road than on the east end, the length of the vectors has to go to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The road regulations near mile-markers 4 and 13. The fixed point is marked with a small dot.\n\n\n\nSuch a point in the state space, where the flow arrows converge, is called a stable fixed point. The “fixed” merely means that the cars come to a standstill. “Stable” means that all cars starting near the fixed point are heading toward that point. Many details of the dynamics near the fixed point have no role in the eventual outcome. For instance, the dynamical function near mile-marker 4 is concave down, while that at mile-marker 13 is concave up. In both cases the behavior of the system is the same: convergence at the stable fixed point.\nAnswer these questions with respect to ?fig-road-rules.\n\nAt mile marker 4, which way is the car going?\n\n\n West        East        At a standstill       \n\nquestion id: dolphin-hang-dish-1\n\n\n\nHow long will it take for the car to go from mile marker 4 to mile marker 0?

The grass has been cut short and the weather is still conducive to growth. What’s going to happen?\nThe grass will grow back, a very simple model of which will be \\(\\partial_t G(t) \\equiv C\\). This rate, \\(\\partial_t G(t)\\), corresponds to the grass growing back at a constant rate. Imagine we measure this rate as tons of biomass per day, and measure time \\(t\\) in days.\n\nTo model the everyday real world of growing grass, should \\(C\\) be positive or negative?\n\n\n\n positive\n\n\n negative\n\n\n zero\n\n\n\nquestion id: pine-win-oven-1\n\n\n\nWhat units does the output \\(G(t)\\) have?\n\n\n\n tons per day\n\n\n tons\n\n\n days\n\n\n tons/day^2\n\n\n\nquestion id: pine-win-oven-2\n\n\n\nWhich of these equations best describes the trajectory of the growing grass under the \\(\\partial_t G(t) = C\\) dynamics?\n\n\n\n \\(G(t) = G(0) + C\\)\n\n\n \\(G(t) = G(0) + C t\\)\n\n\n \\(G(t) = G(0)\\sin(t/C)\\)\n\n\n \\(G(t) = G(0) t + C\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: pine-win-oven-3\n\n\n\nAccording to the dynamics \\(\\partial_t G(t) = C\\), what will \\(G(t)\\) look like (without future harvesting)?\n\n\n\n Growth until the field is choked up with grass.\n\n\n Growth without limit.\n\n\n Oscillating growth and decline as the seasons pass.\n\n\n\nquestion id: pine-win-oven-4\n\n\nThere are two obvious shortcomings of the model \\(\\partial_t G(t) = C\\). First, when the amount of grass is very small (think little spouts spread widely apart) growth should much smaller than when the grass is plentiful. Second, at some point the grass is so dense that further growth is impossible, so \\(\\partial_t G(t)\\) falls to zero (or even negative). The maximum amount of biomass that can be sustained by the field is called the grass’s carrying capacity.\nThe standard simple model for a system with growth to a carrying capacity is \\[\\partial_t G(t) = r G(t)(K-G(t))\\] This model is famous and has a name: logistic growth.\n\nThe logistic growth model has two fixed points.

She rented a car that has not only “cruise control” (a technology from the 1970s that holds a constant speed without driver intervention) but also “car following,” that keeps the car a set distance \\(D\\) behind the car in front. Your cousin, knowing that you are a MOSAIC Calculus reader, asks you how the “car following” system works.\nFirst, define some terms. You tell your cousin to denote the current, instantaneous distance from the car ahead as \\(\\xi\\). You point out that when \\(\\xi - D &gt; 0\\), you’re a greater distance than \\(D\\) from the car ahead and therefore the velocity should be increased so you catch up. On the other hand, when you’re too close (\\(\\xi &lt; D\\)) you should decrease your velocity. The car-following system automates this, the relationship being \\(\\partial_t \\xi = b (\\xi - D)\\).\nYour cousin has never encountered a name like \\(\\xi\\) so you decide to simplify. “Let \\(x = \\xi - D\\), so \\(x\\) is positive if you are too far behind, zero when you’re at the right distance, and negative if you are too far ahead.” Conveniently \\(\\partial_t x = \\partial_t \\xi\\), so you can write down the automatic relationship in terms of \\(x\\): \\(\\partial_t x = b x\\) with \\(b\\) a positive number, such as 1.\n\nWhere is the fixed point of the dynamics \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b x\\)?\n\n\n \\(x=D\\)        \\(x=0\\)        \\(\\xi = 0\\)        There is no fixed point.       \n\nquestion id: seal-fly-socks-1\n\n\n\nIs the fixed point of \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b x\\) (with \\(b &gt; 0\\)) stable?\n\n\n\n Yes, that is why we can leave it to the automatic system.\n\n\n No, the solution grows exponentially as \\(e^{bt}\\).\n\n\n Yes, the solution decays exponentially as \\(e^{bt}\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: seal-fly-socks-2\n\n\nSomething’s wrong with the system you’ve sketched out. You want a stable following distance, doing the right thing if the car ahead speeds up or slows down, but your system is unstable.\n\nWhich of the following rules will have a stable fixed point at \\(x=0\\)?\n\n\n \\(\\partial_t\\, x = -b x\\) (with \\(b &gt; 0\\))        \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b^2 x\\)        \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b x^2\\)        \\(\\partial_t\\, x = 0 x\\)       \n\nquestion id: seal-fly-socks-3\n\n\nThe word “feedback” is used to describe systems where the change in the state is a function of the state. “Negative feedback” is when the change is negative when the state is positive, as in \\(\\partial_t\\, x = -b\\, x\\). Negative feedback is desirable when you want to keep things stable. “Positive feedback” is when the change is the same sign as the state, as in \\(\\partial_t\\, x = b\\, x\\) and makes things unstable.\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 9 The graphs below show two dynamical functions, \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), in the two differential equations \\(\\partial_t x = f(x)\\) and \\(\\partial_t x = g(x)\\).\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor function \\(f(x)\\),\n\nlocate all of the fixed points in the domain \\(-10 \\leq x \\leq 10\\) and determine whether each one is stable or not\nfind the state value \\(x\\) where the state is growing the fastest.\nfind the state value \\(x\\) where the state is decreasing the fastest.\n\nAnswer the questions in (a) but for \\(g(x)\\).\n\n\n\nExercise 10 The dynamical function in the graph is a sixth-order polynomial. It has several fixed points, labelled “a”, “b”, “c”, and so on.\nThe numbers i, ii, iii, etc. mark some initial conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of the initial conditions marked in the graph, say whether the long-term behavior of the trajectory from that point will lead to one of the fixed points (and which one) or to \\(-\\infty\\) or \\(\\infty\\). (Hint: That the function is a sixth-order polynomial should tell you something about the functions behavior beyond the domain shown in the graph.)\n\n\nExercise 11 Here is a generic, linear differential equation:\n\\[\\partial_t x = a x + b\\ .\\] 1. How many fixed points are in this system?\n\nFor one of the fixed points you identified in (1), what is the value for the location \\(x^\\star\\) in terms of the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)?\nFor one of the fixed points, translate the equation to be in terms of \\(y\\) in \\[\\partial_t y = ???\\ .\\]\nWrite down the symbolic solution to the equation in (3). (Hint: it will involve the parameter \\(a\\) but not \\(b\\).)\nTranslate the solution in (4) back into terms of \\(x\\). (Hint: The solution will involve both parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).)\n\n\n\nExercise 12 Use differentiation to verify that \\[y(t) = 4 e^{2 t} + 7\\] is a solution to the differential equation \\[\\partial_t y = 2 y - 14\\ .\\]\n\n\nExercise 13  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the dynamical system graphed above, sketch a plausible time series solution starting from initial condition \\(x_0=-2.5\\).\n\n\n\nExercise 14  \n\nSuppose that \\(p(t)\\) is the population density of squirrels over time. Draw the dynamical function \\(s(p)\\) in the differential equation \\[\\partial_t p = s(p)\\] that will produce a population that grows from a very small density of 4 squirrels per hectare to a carrying capacity of 50 squirrels per hectare. Mark the units on your graph.\nChallenge: Arrange the units on the output of \\(s(p)\\) so that it will take roughly 3 months to reach the carrying capacity.\n\n\n\nExercise 15 Coffee at an initial temperature of \\(T=\\) 80 degrees C is in a closed thermos at a (very cold) construction site where the ambient temperature is -20 C. Suppose, with the thermos closed, it takes 4 hours for the coffee to fall to a tepid 30 degrees C. The thermos cools in accord with Newton’s Law of Cooling.\nDraw a quantitatively reasonable graph of the dynamical function consistent with these facts in the differential equation \\[\\partial_t T = f(T)\\ .\\]\n\n\n\nExercise 16 A first-order dynamical system \\(\\partial_t x = g(x)\\) can have any number of fixed points, depending on the shape of \\(g(x)\\).\nA. Draw a graph of a \\(g(x)\\) that has seven fixed points.\nB. Explain why, when there are multiple fixed points, a stable fixed point will have a neighboring fixed point that is unstable, and vice versa.\n\n\nExercise 17 A debit card is a way to make withdrawals from a bank account. Funds in the account earn interest. In the economic environment of 2021, the interest rate is practically zero. But to make it possible to see the growth on a graph, we will stipulate it to be 4% per year. But if the account is in debt, then the debt grows at a much faster rate, perhaps 15% per year.\nSuppose the amount in the bank account is \\(m\\) (in dollars) and time is \\(t\\) (in years). If \\(m\\) is positive, you are earning interest. If negative, you are in debt and the debt will grow.\n\nWhich of the following graphs reflects the dynamics of the system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scenarios A and B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scenarios C and D\n\n\n\n\nOn the graph paper below, sketch out the modifications of the bank-card dynamics described.

(See XREF not implemented yet.) This problem concerns a model Richardson built to account for arms races between countries.\nIn the model, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) respectively refer to the size of the military of the two countries. The equations model how the size of the militaries change in time:\n\\[\\left[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\dot{x} & = & a y - m x & + r\\\\\n\\dot{y} & = & b x - n y & + s\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\right]\\]\nThe terms \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) represent the basic grievances between the two countries.\nThe parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent “fear,” that is, the extent to which one country feels the need to build up arms in response to the other country’s arms.\nThe parameters \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are about the internal dynamics of the country: its ability/desire to sustain a large military.\n\nWhat should the signs of \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) be if the countries have substantial grievances against each other?\n\n\n positive        negative        zero       \n\nquestion id: owl-sell-radio-1\n\n\n\nWhat should be the signs of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), given that they represent “fear?”\n\n\n positive        negative        zero       \n\nquestion id: owl-sell-radio-2\n\n\n\nWhat should be the signs of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), in a country which, on its own, would not like to build a large military? Note the sign preceeding these terms.\n\n\n positive        negative        zero       \n\nquestion id: owl-sell-radio-3\n\n\nDepending on the values of the parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), and \\(s\\), the Richardson dynamics can produce different outcomes. Two of the previous three plots show Richardson Arms Race dynamics for two mutually fearful countries with mutual grievances, Freedonia and Jockavia. The third plot does not; the signs of one of the coefficients has been reversed and so the dynamics don’t make sense for modeling an arms race.\n\nIn each of the three plots, start from initial point \\(x=2,y=1\\), that is, a situation where Freedonia is more armed than Jackavia, and trace out the trajectory over time.\nFor each of the three plots, find any equilibrium point and say whether it is stable or unstable. If there is no equilibrium, move on.\nIdentify which of the three plots is NOT the Richardson dynamics.\nIn the non-Richardson flow, which coefficient has been reversed: it is one of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), or \\(s\\).\n\n\nWhich of the previous plots are Not the Richardson Dynamics?\n\n\n Flow Field A        Flow Field B        Flow Field C       \n\nquestion id: owl-sell-radio-4\n\n\n\nIn this plot which if the parameters is reversed?\n\n\n a        b        m        n        r        s       \n\nquestion id: owl-sell-radio-5\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 Lanchester’s model of combat is \\[\\partial_t R = - b B\\\\\n\\partial_t B = -r R\\] with both parameters \\(r\\) and \\(b\\) taken to be positive.\nObviously, the state variables \\(R\\) and \\(B\\) are to be thought of as functions of time.\n\nLocate the fixed point of the model of combat. \nIs it stable? In answering this question, consider two different state spaces and explain why your answer is different in the two spaces:\n\nAll four quadrants of the \\((R, B)\\) plane.\nOnly the first quadrant—that is, \\(0 \\leq R, 0 \\leq B\\)—of the \\((R, B)\\) pane.\n\n\nAt a stable fixed point the state quantities—\\(R\\) and \\(B\\) here—do not change. But sometimes there are other functions of the state variables that do not change even when the state is off of any fixed point. These are called conserved quantities. Conserved quantities such as momentum and energy are important in physics.\nThe text introduced this conserved quantity for Lanchester’s model: \\[Q(R, B) \\equiv rR^2 - b B^2\\ .\\] Let’s explore whether the components of the quantity are conserved individually.\n\nCalculate \\(\\partial_t r R^2\\). Which of these is right? (Hint: Use the chain rule of differentiation and Lanchester’s equations to simplify more.)\n\n\n \\(-2 rb RB\\)        \\(2rR\\)        \\(-2r\\dot{R}\\)        \\(2r\\dot{R} B\\)\n      \n\nquestion id: ptp47-3\n\n\n\nPerform the similar calculation \\(\\partial_t b B^2\\). Using your result and the result from question (3), is it the case that \\(\\partial_t r R^2 = \\partial_t b B^2\\)?\n\n\n Yes        No        Depends on \\(b\\) and \\(r\\).        Depends on \\(B\\) and \\(R\\).       \n\nquestion id: ptp47-4\n\n\nHere are two more candidates for conserved quantities:\n\n\\(rR - bB\\)\n\\(rB - bR\\)\n\nTake the derivative with respect to time of each of them to determine if they are conserved.\n\nWhich of (a) and (b) are conserved?\n\n\n\n Just (a).\n\n\n Just (b).\n\n\n Both (a) and (b).\n\n\n Neither (a) nor (b).\n\n\n\nquestion id: ptp47-5\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3  \n\nWhich of the three flows below corresponds to Lanchester’s Law?\n\n\n A        B        C       \n\nquestion id: hamster-bend-sofa-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these sentences best describes the dynamics of Lanchester’s Law?\n\n\n\n Both forces battle to complete annihilation.\n\n\n The stronger force wipes out the weaker force.\n\n\n The weaker force holds off the stronger force.\n\n\n\nquestion id: hamster-bend-sofa-2\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 Here are three different first-order differential equations with fixed points at \\(x^\\star = 0\\) and \\(x^\\star=1\\).\n\n\\(\\partial_t x = g_1(x) \\equiv x (1-x)\\)\n\\(\\partial_t x = g_2(x) \\equiv 0.25 \\sin(2\\pi x)\\)\n\\[\\partial_t x = g_3(x) \\equiv \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\nx & x &lt; 0.18\\\\\n0.18 & 0.18 \\leq x \\leq 0.82\\\\\n1 -x & 0.82 &lt; x\n\\end{array}\\right.\\] The \\(g_i()\\) functions are graphed below.\n\nA. For each of the equations, match the number (i, ii, iii) to the color (magenta, blue, black). Comment on the differences in shape among them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. By eye, integrate each of the differential equations from initial condition \\(x_0 = 0.01\\). Compare the time series plots. Do the dynamics of \\(g_3()\\) product a similar or radically different time series than \\(g_1()\\) and \\(g_2()\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment: Usually, many different mathematical functions can be used to model a given phenomenon. The different functions will have similar shapes, but do not need to be identical.\n\n\n\nExercise 5 In the rabbit/fox system, the quantity \\[Q(R, F) = \\delta R - \\gamma \\ln(R) + \\beta F - \\alpha \\ln(F)\\] is conserved.\nThis means that each of the level curves (contours) in the contour plot of \\(Q(R, F)\\) is follows the path of a trajectory.\n\nMake a contour plot of \\(Q(R, F)\\) over the domain \\(0.1 \\leq R \\leq 3\\), \\(0 \\leq F \\leq 2\\) for \\(\\alpha=.66, \\beta = 1.33, \\gamma=1, \\delta = 1\\).\nFrom the graph you made in (1), choose an appropriate initial condition that falls on one of the contours.\nUsing integrateODE(), find the trajectory from from the initial condition in (1) for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 10\\). Add a layer to the graphic in (1) showing the trajectory to confirm that the conserved quantities are indeed conserved.\nSymbolically, calculate \\(\\partial_t Q(R, V)\\). You will need to use the chain rule, which will leave you with terms \\(\\partial_t R\\) and \\(\\partial_t F\\). Plug in the values for these from the differential equations and show that \\(\\partial_t Q(R, V) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6 Newton’s Law of Cooling is about how a hot (or cold) object comes into equilibrium with the ambient temperature. For instance, you might have a cup of coffee at \\(200^\\circ\\)F in a room at \\(70^\\circ\\)F. Unless you drink it, the coffee will cool with time until it reaches the room’s temperature. In this setting, \\(x_\\text{fixed} = 70^\\circ\\)F. The value of \\(a\\) depends on how insulated the cup is (and details of evaporation, etc.). But if the coffee reaches very near to room temperature in 60 minutes, \\(a \\approx 0.5\\) with units 1/minute.\n\nWhat are the units of the output of \\(x(t)\\)?\n\n\n degrees F per minute        degrees F        1/minute        1/degrees F       \n\nquestion id: birch-bring-bed-1\n\n\n\nWhat are the units of \\(\\dot{x}\\)?\n\n\n degrees F per minute        degrees F        1/minute        1/degrees F       \n\nquestion id: birch-bring-bed-2\n\n\n\nWhat is \\(x\\)?\n\n\n\n the room temperature\n\n\n the initial temperature of the coffee\n\n\n the instantaneous coffee temperature as a function of time\n\n\n the fixed rate at which the coffee cools\n\n\n the instantaneous rate at which the coffee cools as a function of time\n\n\n\nquestion id: birch-bring-bed-3\n\n\n\nWhat is \\(\\dot{x}\\)?\n\n\n\n the room temperature\n\n\n the initial temperature of the coffee\n\n\n the instantaneous coffee temperature as a function of time\n\n\n the instantaneous rate at which the coffee cools as a function of time\n\n\n\nquestion id: birch-bring-bed-4\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7 Our generic model for limited growth is\n\\[\\partial_t x = r x (1-x/k)\\ ,\\] which you can see as a modification of the proportional-growth model \\[\\partial_t x = r x\\ .\\]\nThe proportional-growth model will lead to \\(x(t)\\) increasing without limit. Sometimes that is a good model over short times, before \\(x(t)\\) has a chance to get unrealistically big. But over long periods of time, something’s gotta give.\nThe limited growth model involves a carrying capacity \\(k\\). For \\(t\\) when \\(x(t)\\) is very small, the population growth is well approximated by the usual proportion-growth model. For intermediate \\(t\\), the population has grown to a large enough size that it is consuming a substantial fraction of the available resources and population growth slows. When the population reaches the carrying capacity the growth stops (e.g. birth rate = death rate).\n\nIf the units of \\(x(t)\\) is, say, rabbits, what is the units of \\(k\\)?\n\n\n\n rabbits\n\n\n rabbits per day\n\n\n rabbits per week\n\n\n rabbits per year\n\n\n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-sharpen-knob-1\n\n\n\nSuppose the units of \\(\\dot{x}\\) is, rabbits per month, what is the units of \\(r\\)?\n\n\n\n 1/month\n\n\n rabbits per month\n\n\n months per rabbit\n\n\n rabbits per month-squared\n\n\n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-sharpen-knob-2\n\n\n\nEven without finding the full solution \\(x(t)\\) to the differential equation, you can figure out how big the population will be when growth falls to zero. How big?\n\n\n \\(k\\)        \\(k/r\\)        \\(r/k\\)        \\(1/r\\)       \n\nquestion id: rhinosaurus-sharpen-knob-3\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 8 In the description of the SIR model, we pointed out how a model of recovery \\(\\partial_t I = -\\alpha I\\) differs from the usual “recover after 7 days” style of description. (See MC_xref(\"fig-recovery-pattern\").)\nFind a value of \\(\\alpha\\) such that the expectation value of the time to recovery is 7 days. To do this:\n\nFind a formula for the function \\(I(t)\\) from the differential equation.\nGuess an appropriate value for \\(\\alpha\\).\nConstruct the appropriate integral using \\(I(t)\\) to find the expectation value of \\(t\\). (See Chapter XREF not implemented yet.)\nModify your guess for \\(\\alpha\\) until the expectation value comes out to 7.\n\n\n\nLoading required namespace: cubature\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9 The Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR) model has only two parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\\[\\partial_t S = -\\beta S I\\\\\n\\partial_t I = \\beta S I - \\alpha I\\]\nThe \\(\\alpha\\) parameter controls how long it takes for an infective to recover. If we are considering only recovery, and not the introduction of new infectives from the susceptible population, the relevant differential equation is simply \\[\\partial_t I = \\alpha I\\ .\\] 1. Set \\(\\alpha\\) so that the half-life for infectiveness is 5 days.\n\n\nUsing \\(\\beta = 0.5\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) as in (1), set up a numerical integration of the SIR model. Integrate out to \\(t=100\\) from an initial condition of \\(S=0.999\\) and \\(I=0.001\\), corresponding to 0.1% of the population being infected. Plot out the time series \\(S(t)\\). From the time series, what fraction of the population eventually get the disease?\nOne sort of government tactic to keep small the spread of disease is to close borders, with the idea that there will be fewer infectives at the start of the epidemic which will keep the epidemic smaller. Public health professionals are skeptical of this common-sense tactic. Follow the same procedure in (2), but set the initial condition to \\(S=0.99999\\) and \\(I=0.00001\\). Does common sense hold?\nAnother strategy is “social distancing” and isolating infectives. To model this, reduce \\(\\beta\\), the rate at which susceptibles interact with infectives. Keeping \\(\\alpha\\) at the value you determined in (1), set \\(\\beta\\) that only about half the susceptibles are ever infected.\n\n\n43-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

To use the language of linear combinations, an eigenvalue is a scalar. As you know, when you multiply a vector times a scalar, the result has the same direction (or the exact opposite direction) but might be longer or shorter. Like this: \\[ 3 \\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\2 \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}3\\\\6 \\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{or}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n-4 \\left[\\begin{array}{r}3\\\\-1 \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{r}-12\\\\4\\end{array}\\right]\\] In contrast, matrix multiplication of a vector can generate a result that has a different direction than the original vector, like this:\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{rc}0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\cdot \\left[\\begin{array}{c}2 \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right] =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{1}{2} \\\\2\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{or}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\left[\\begin{array}{rc}-1 & \\frac{3}{4} \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\cdot \\left[\\begin{array}{r}1 \\\\ -4\\end{array}\\right] =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c}4 \\\\1\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nAn eigenvector is a vector has a seemingly magical property with respect to multiplication by the matrix it characterizes: the result of the multiplication is a vector that has the same direction as the original but scaled by it is corresponding eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\). That is, if \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\({\\mathbf M}\\) and \\({\\mathbf \\Lambda}\\) is the corresponding eigenvector: \\[{\\mathbf M}\\cdot {\\mathbf \\Lambda} = \\lambda {\\mathbf \\Lambda}\\]\n\nWhich of these is an eigenvector of the matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rc}-1 & \\frac{3}{4} \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\)? (Hint: Multiply the matrix by each of the vectors listed. For one of them, the result of the multiplication will be aligned with the vector used. You can use the constant of proportionality to answer the next question, but you will have to start by choosing the right one of the options that follow.)\n\n\n\n \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{r}-3\\\\2\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n\n\n \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{r}3\\\\2\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n\n\n \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{r}-2\\\\3\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n\n\n \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{r}2\\\\3\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: char1-3\n\n\n\nWhat is the eigenvalue associated with the correct answer from the previous problem?\n\n\n -1.5        -1        -0.5        0.5        1.5       \n\nquestion id: char1-4\n\n\n\nConsider the two matrices \\[{\\mathbf M}_1 = \\left[\\begin{array}{rr}5 & 6 \\\\0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\left[\\begin{array}{rr}-3 & 1 \\\\0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\] Which of the following is not an eigenvector of \\({\\mathbf M}_1\\) or of \\({\\mathbf M}_2\\)?

In the initial code in the sandbox is a test that shows whether a vector v is an eigenvector of M. In this example it is and has eigenvalue 0.5615 (rounding off to 4 decimal places). You can print out M or v in the ordinary way, with the simple commands M or v respectively.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nExercise 3 We will work with the linear dynamical system\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t x & = -x\\\\\n\\partial_t y & = -11 x - 2 y\\ .\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nUsing integrateODE() find the solution \\(x(t)\\) for \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 10\\) for each of these three initial conditions:\nTrajectory 1) \\(x_0=1, y_0=-1\\)\nTrajectory 2) \\(x_0=0, y_0=1\\)\nTrajectory 3) \\(x_0=1, y_0=0\\)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe three solutions will be the functions T1$x(), T2$x(), and T3$x().\nSince the dynamics are linear, there will be a simple relationship between the three solutions, just as there is a simple relationship between three vectors in a 2-dimensional vector space.\nFind this simple relationship and make a graph that demonstrate it.\n\n\n\nExercise 4 The only fixed point of the rabbit-fox system is \\(\\left(r^\\star, f^\\star\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}, -\\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma}\\right)\\)\nThe linearized dynamics around this fixed point are: \\[\\partial_t r =\n\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\beta\\gamma}{\\delta}\\right) [r - r^\\star] +\n\\alpha [f - f^\\star]\\\\\n\\partial_t f =\n- \\delta [r - r^\\star] +\n\\left(\\delta + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{\\delta}\\right) [f - f^\\star]\\]\nUsing the formula for eigenvalues, calculate the eigenvalues symbolically and report on the stability of the fixed point.\n\n\nExercise 5 In this exercise, you will be using an app that allows you to set \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the [ab10] matrix and hunt for eigenvectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the app in another browser tab and arrange it side-by-side with this document, so you can see both at the same time.\nYou used a somewhat similar app when exploring linear, two-dimensional finite-difference equations. Here’s a link, but you don’t need to open that app for this exercise.\nThis new app does a few things differently:\n\nIn the old app, you had four number-entry boxes to set the values of the [abcd] matrix. Here, because we are using the [ab10] format, you need only set \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). You can do this by clicking within the left-hand graph.\nThe a-b selector graph is annotated with the type of generic behavior that the differential-equation system will show for any combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This allows you to reason backward from the behavior you are interested in to the corresponding values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the type of behavior is encoded in the eigenvalues, you are effectively inverting the eigenvalue formula to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nThe flow field (right-hand graph) shows stream-lines of continuous-time motion. Imagine you had a bunch of glitter which you cast out over a pool of water with a given flow pattern. If you took a time-exposure photo, you would see each piece of glitter as it moved along with the water in which it is embedded.\nYou can click in the flow field to start a trajectory at that point. You can control the time domain—that is, how long is the time exposure of the photo—with the radio buttons at the bottom.\nThere is a thin, green line annotating the flow field. This line runs from the fixed point (right in the center) in the direction of the point on which you click to start a trajectory. A vector with the same orientation as the green line is given numerically below the graph. This orientation is also described using an angle measurement in degrees.\nThere is no display of the solution, that is, \\(x()\\) versus \\(t\\). This is because we want you to understand the geometry of the flow.\n\nFirst, play around with the app. Choose miscellaneous values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), observe the flow, and click in the flow field to draw a red trajectory. Notice what happens when you make the number of steps larger or smaller. In unstable directions, you can get a good view of the trajectory by starting it near the fixed point. If you start it at the periphery of the graph, most of the trajectory will be outside the display. And if the number of steps is very small, you may not see it at all because the glyph is so thin near the start.\nWhen coming from a stable direction, click near the periphery of the graph to get a good view, since the red trajectory will naturally be heading in towards the origin. When estimating the orientation of an eigenvector, try to get the green line heading straight down the middle of the red trajectory. This often requires a bit of fiddling, moving the starting point just a tiny amount to find one that is just right.\nWhen you are on an eigenvector, the trajectory will be dead straight on the green line. Any trajectory not starting on an eigenvector will be curved to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the relative sizes of the eigenvalues.\nIn the following questions, pick the choice closest to the answer you found. The exact choice of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) stemming from a click depends somewhat on the graphics resolution of your display, so you should expect only to be able to get close to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) values given in the question.\n\nSet \\(a=-1.0\\) and \\(b = 0.5\\) (or as close as you can get) and observe the flow. This is a saddle: stable in one direction, unstable in another. There will be one stable eigenvector, where the flow moves directly outward from the origin, and one unstable eigenvector, where the flow moves directly inward toward the origin.

Without friction the spring-mass force-balance differential equation is \\(m\\partial_{tt} x =  -k\\, x\\). How does friction fit in?\nFor a mass moving at velocity \\(\\partial_t{x}\\), the friction force will be in the direction opposed to the velocity and, when velocity is zero, friction goes away. Following our general calculus idea of approximating with a simple straight-line function, we get a force \\(\\text{friction} = -r \\partial_t{x}\\). Adding in the friction force gives a new force-balance equation which has a famous name in physics: the “damped harmonic oscillator.”\n\\[m \\partial_{tt}{x} = -r \\partial_t{x} - k x\\] Note that all of the coefficients \\(m, r\\), and \\(k\\) are positive\nSince we’ve gotten in the habit of using \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) on the right side of the equation, we will re-write the force-balance equation as \\[\\partial_{tt}{x} = a \\partial_t{x} + b x\\] where \\(a = -r/m\\) and \\(b = -k/m\\).\nAs the name “damped harmonic oscillator” suggests, we expect that the solution to the force-balance equation will be a “damped” oscillation, that is an oscillation that decreases in amplitude over time as friction draws energy out of the system (and dissipates it as heat). But how fast and in what form will the amplitude decrease?\n\nSuppose that friction is strong, that is \\(a\\) is big. More specifically, suppose \\(a^2 &gt; 4 b\\). What will be true about \\(\\sqrt{\\strut a^2 - 4b}\\)?\n\n\n\n It will be purely “imaginary”.\n\n\n It will be purely “real”.\n\n\n It will be complex, that is with a non-zero real part and a non-zero imaginary part.\n\n\n There is no way to tell for sure.\n\n\n\nquestion id: pine-bring-window-1\n\n\n\nWhen \\(a^2 &gt; 4b\\), can either of the eigenvalues be positive?\n\n\n\n No\n\n\n Yes, one eigenvalue can be positive.\n\n\n Both eigenvalues must be positive.\n\n\n Depends on the specific values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n\n\nquestion id: pine-bring-window-2\n\n\nWhen friction dominates (that is, large \\(|a|\\)) the eigenvalues are both real and negative. This means there is no oscillation and the motion decays to \\(x = 0\\).\n\nQuestion: Suppose that friction is weak, that is \\(a^2 &lt; 4|b|\\). What will be true about \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + 4b}\\)?\n\n\n\n It will be purely “imaginary”.\n\n\n It will be purely “real”.\n\n\n It will be complex, that is with a non-zero real part and a non-zero imaginary part.\n\n\n There is no way to tell for sure.\n\n\n\nquestion id: pine-bring-window-3\n\n\nSuppose that we define \\(\\omega \\equiv \\sqrt{\\strut 4b - a^2}/2\\) and \\(k = a/2\\). (Recall, that for \\(a\\) to describe friction, we must have \\(a &lt; 0\\).)

In a step outside of calculus (meaning: you won’t be examined on it) it is worth pointing out the correspondence between concepts of motion (acceleration, velocity, position) and electrical circuits (voltage, current, charge). There are three classical idealized passive components of circuits:\n\ncapacitor, denoted \nresistor, denoted \ninductor, denoted \n\nIn every case, we will be interested in the voltage across the two ends of the component. And we will think about the dynamics of the circuit in terms of electrical charge which we will denote \\(x\\).\n\nFor a capacitor the voltage is proportional to charge \\(x/C\\), where \\(C\\) is the “size” of the capacitor.\nFor a resistor the voltage is proportional to the flow of charge, that is, current \\(r \\dot{x}\\), where \\(R\\) is the amount of resistance, basically the “size” of the resistor.\nFor an inductor the voltage is proportional to the change in the flow of charge, that is, \\(L \\ddot{x}\\), where \\(L\\) is the inductance.\n\nOnly a capacitor is capable of holding a voltage on its own. The other circuit elements can carry a voltage when they are part of a circuit. we will explore a simple circuit.\n\nTo prime the circuit, we will connect the two dots at the bottom of the circuit with a battery. This will charge up the capacitor in much the same way as we “charge up” a spring by pulling on it. Next remove the battery and get ready to observe the motion. Complete the circuit by closing the switch between the two dots. Doing so establishes the circuit, analogous to setting up the dynamics of the system. The initial condition is the amount of charge \\(x\\) on the capacitor and, at the instant the switch is closed, no flow of current, giving \\(\\dot{x} = 0\\).\nThe “force-balance” is the requirement that the sum of the voltages across the circuit elements be zero. This amounts to\n\\[L \\partial_{tt} {x} = -R\\, \\partial_t{x} - \\frac{1}{C} x \\]\n\nConsider a circuit with inductance \\(L=1\\), resistance \\(R=3\\) and capacitance \\(C = 1\\). What will be the eigenvalues of the dynamics? Will the fixed point at \\(x=0\\) be stable or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[-3 \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut 9 - 4 }\\right] = (-3 \\pm \\sqrt{5})/2\\) so \\(\\lambda_1 \\approx -0.382\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 \\approx -2.618\\). Since both eigenvalues are negative, the fixed point is stable.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s decrease the the resistence to \\(R=2\\) and the capacitance to \\(C = 1/2\\). What are the eigenvalues of the dynamics?\n\n\n\n \\(\\lambda_1 = -1 + 1i\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = -1 - 1i\\)\n\n\n \\(\\lambda_1 = -1 + 1i\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = 1 - 1i\\)\n\n\n \\(\\lambda_1 = 1 + 1i\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = 1 - 1i\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: falcon-shut-hamper-2\n\n\n\nWhat will be the frequency of the solution \\(x(t)\\)?\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 4 XREF not implemented yet gives the equations for the motion of a cannonball with a simple model of air resistance and shows how to integrate them numerically with integrateODE().\nYou task is to set the initial conditions for velocity so that the ball is being fired 250 feet per second at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal. These initial conditions will be \\(v_0 = 250 \\sin\\left(\\strut \\pi \\theta/180\\right)\\) and \\(u_0 = 250 \\cos\\left(\\strut \\pi \\theta/180\\right)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) has units of degrees.\nOnce you have the numerical integration working, find an argmin for \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the horizontal distance travelled by the cannonball.\n\n\nExercise 5 Most any mathematics textbook devotes a considerable amount of space to deriving formulas. This is well and good. But in practical work, there is considerable room for error even if you already know the formula.\nIt is a good professional practice to try to have at least two ways to perform a calculation so that you can confirm that you are doing the calculation properly. In this exercise, we give you a formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an abcd matrix. And, of course, there is the eigen() function that should give the same results as the formula.\nYour task is to use both eigen() and the formulas directly to confirm that the two calculations are the same. The formulas have symbols; replace these with numbers of your choice to do the calculations.\nYou might start with numbers that are simple integers, then switch to numbers that are more or less random.\nThe formula for the eigenvalues of an abcd matrix \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\\\c & d\\end{array}\\right]\\] is \\[\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[{\\large\\strut}(a-d)^2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\strut(a+d)^2 - 4bc}\\right]\\ .\\]\nOnce you know the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors can be calculated this way: \\[\\vec{\\Lambda_1} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\lambda_1 - d\\\\c\\end{array}\\right]\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ \\ \\vec{\\Lambda_2} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\lambda_2 - d\\\\c\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\nCalculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}1 & 0 \\\\-2 & 6\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nCalculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}8 & 6 \\\\4 & -1\\end{array}\\right]\\]\nCalculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{rr}-9 & 2\\\\8 & -6\\end{array}\\right]\\]\n\n\n\nExercise 6 An eigenvector \\(\\vec{\\Lambda}\\) of a matrix \\(\\mathit{M}\\) always has this property:\n\\[\\mathit{M} \\vec{\\Lambda} = \\lambda \\vec{\\Lambda}\\] This merely says that if you multiply a matrix by one of its eigenvectors, the result is a vector that points in the same direction as the eigenvector but may have a different length or reversed orientation.\nYour task:\n\nConstruct a numerical abcd matrix with whatever values you like and, using eigen(), calculate its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nMultiply the matrix by one of the eigenvectors to create a new vector.\nConfirm that the vector in (2) is proportional to the eigenvector. When two vectors are proportional, dividing component-wise one vector by the other will create a vector with every element the same. (Note: if both of the vectors in the division have any zero component, the result of the division will be NaN. In contrast, if one of the vectors has a zero component, but the other does not, you will get a result of 0 or Inf for that component.)\n\n\n\nExercise 7 You’ve seen that sometimes the two eigenvalues of an abcd matrix are complex numbers, that is, have a nonzero imaginary part. You may also have noticed that the eigenvalues are closely related to one another: the imaginary part of one will be the negative of the imaginary part of the other. Such vectors are called complex conjugates.\nWhenever a matrix has a complex eigenvalue, it will also have the complex conjugate of that eigenvalue; complex eigenvalues always come in pairs.\nFor a 2x2 matrix, there will be two eigenvalues. If one is complex, the other will be the complex conjugate.\nFor a 3x3 matrix, either one or all three of the eigenvalues will not be complex.\nHere’s a way to generate a random nxn matrix:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYour task: for \\(n=3\\), run the previous commands over and over, 20 times altogether. Report what fraction of the time the random matrix generated has 3 real eigenvalues. (Note: Something like 1.548950+0.00000i is a real eigenvalue, because the imaginary part is zero.)\n\n\nExercise 8 Consider the second-order linear differential equation\n\\[\\partial_{tt}\\ x = - b\\ \\partial_t\\ x - a\\ x\\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are scalars.\nThe only state variable listed explicitly in the second-order equation is \\(x\\).\n\nDefine a new state variable \\(v \\equiv \\partial_t x\\) and use it to re-write the second-order equation as two first-order differential equations: \\[\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t v & = ????\\\\\n\\partial_t x & = ????\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nConfirm that the matrix equivalent to the pair of first order equations is \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\\\1 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\ .\\]\nThe ab-matrix in (2) has only two parameters, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Consider the following four-parameter abcd matrix:\n\\[\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\\\c & d\\end{array}\\right]\\ ?\\] Can the ab-matrix create the full range of dynamical behaviors seen in the abcd-matrix?\n\nTo answer this question, we will return to the app that displays flows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An app for displaying the flows induced by a 2x2 matrix. Go to https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/142Z-Eigenflows/ to access the interactive app.\n\n\n\nYou can see in the ab-selector graph on the left annotations for several types of generic behaviour:\n\nSaddle (unstable along one eigenvector, stable along the other)\nSources (unstable along both eigenvectors)\nSinks (stable along both eigenvectors)\nStable oscillation (spirals toward the fixed point)\nUnstable oscillation (spirals away from the fixed point)\n\nIn the ab-selector graph, these are encoded by color and shading. The blue parabola marks the ab-region of oscillation; stability is indicated using dark shading. Saddles are at the top of the ab-graph. Sources and sinks are the gray arches rising up from the edges of the graph.\nThe shading is set by calculating the eigenvalues for each (a, b)-pair\nWhat sorts of trajectories, if any, are not produced by ab10 compared to the possibilities provided by the abcd matrix?\n\nUnderneath the graph are two numeric-input widgets, one to set the \\(c\\) parameter, the other to set \\(d\\). By default, these are set to display an [ab10] matrix, but you can change them.\n\nPlay with the \\(c\\)- and \\(d\\)-inputs to see how that changes the flow field (right graph) and the shaded regions. Make small changes to \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) at first to get a feeling for what the controls do to the display. Then you can explore large changes.\nDoes any new type of behavior appear when \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are moved from their [ab10] settings?\n\n46-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

To simplify, let’s use 20 days as the doubling time.\nImagine a region containing \\(N = 100,000\\) people. Public health statistics are often given in rates per 100,000 (or per 10,000 or per 1000), so this is a convenient number mathematically.\nNear the start of the epidemic, almost everyone is susceptible and there is just a small number of infectives or recovered.

You can read both these quantities off the graphs.\nThe peak rate of infection and the population fraction are presumably related to the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Try modifying these slightly to see what the relationship is. You’ll have to be careful in interpreting the meaning of “slightly.” You want the changes to be “slight” in terms of the physical meaning of the parameters, perhaps doubling or halving the physical manifestation of the numerical value of the parameters.\nEssay 5: How does halving the quantity “doubling time” affect the population fraction?

In terms of the model, these all come down to adjusting the values of the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and/or \\(\\beta\\), or changing the initial conditions of the model.\nFor instance, the effect of social distancing might be modeled by increasing the doubling time for transmission. Vaccination could be modeled by moving people from the \\(S\\) compartment to the \\(R\\) compartment. You can do this in the code by manipulating the terms in the IntegrateODE function.\nEssay 10: Suppose at the start of the epidemic you could vaccinate 70% of the population with a vaccine that is only 50% effective. Run the model to find out how would this change the population fraction and peak infection rate.

What is this threshold when you use your previously calculated alpha and beta values?\n  question id: using-SIR-essay-11 \nAnother way to intervene is to change \\(\\alpha\\). You might think that \\(\\alpha\\) depends only on the biology of recovery, but this is not so. For instance, you can sequester people identified as infected or at high risk of becoming infective. Tools such as contact tracing are useful for this.\nOne of the strategies used in China to contain the outbreak in March and April 2020 was to isolate infectives. Voluntarily or not, those with a positive COVID test were removed from their families and placed in hospitals, some of which had been specially constructed at short notice. Widespread, rapid testing and response can also help to reduce the time that an infective is in contact with susceptibles.\nEssay 12: Would sequestering infectives correspond to an increase in \\(\\alpha\\) or a decrease?

    "text": "An endemic future?\nA feature of the SIR model as stated here is that the rate of new infectives eventually falls to zero; the outbreak comes to an end. In the real world, however, diseases can become endemic, meaning that there is always a background rate of new infections that can smolder until such time as the susceptible population recovers. One mechanism for this is births. The classic childhood illnesses of your grandparents’ time—measles, mumps, rubella, even polio—were endemic and new outbreaks would occur as the number of susceptible children accumulated over years.\nLet’s explore another possibility about which there has been considerable speculation. Imagine that “recovered” people regain their susceptibility at a low rate, perhaps over the course of a year or more.\nThis would change the \\(R\\) component of the SIR model to look like \\[\\dot{R} = \\alpha I - \\gamma R\\] where that flow out of \\(R\\) would become a flow into \\(S\\).

Write down the Newton-step suitable for the argmax problem.\n\n  question id: kid-rise-coat-1 \n\nImagine that \\(g(x)\\) has an output of miles-per-gallons and an input speed in miles-per-hour.

(The situation is illustrated in Figure 1.) The length of the Newton step is proportional to \\(1/f'(x_0)\\), which is large when \\(f'(x_0) \\approx 0\\). Such a Newton step can produce \\(x^\\star\\) further from the actual solution rather than closer to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An unlucky choice of \\(x_0\\) (marked in magenta) near a local maximum has resulted in a Newton step that is too long. The Newton step creates \\(x_1 \\approx -3\\), far to the left of the actual zero crossing which is near \\(x\\approx 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a second Newton step, that is, a step starting at \\(x_1\\) and ending at \\(x_2\\). You can eyeball the linear function that approximates \\(f(x)\\) near \\(x_1\\). What is the approximate value of \\(x_2\\).\nTry a simple modification to Newton’s method that can help deal with such situations. In the figure above, the full Newton step puts \\(x_1\\) where the dotted line crosses the brown line. This full step has length \\(\\| x_1 - x_0 \\|\\), in this case roughly 4.5.\n\nIn your modification, instead of taking the full Newton step, take a step from \\(x_0\\) that is only half as long. That half step will bring you to a new \\(x_1\\). From there, take another half Newton step to find \\(x_2\\). Will this process converge toward the actual zero crossing of \\(f(x)\\)?\n\n\nExercise 5  \n\nWrite a Newton-step better() function to solve for \\(x\\) in the equation \\(\\sin(x) = \\cos(x)\\). Start with the guess \\(x_0 = 0\\) and iterate better() enough times to get \\(\\| x_i - x^\\star\\| &lt; 0.001\\).\n\nTo help, we will give the hint that \\(x^\\star \\approx 0.785\\).\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 2\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we hadn’t told you the answer \\(x^\\star\\). How could you know, just from your iterations of better(), that you are very close to the true answer.\n\n  question id: fish-ring-door \n\n\nExercise 6 A simple robot arm to move things in the \\((x,y)\\) plane consists of two links, the first connected to the base of the robot and the second to the free end of the first link, as in the diagram. At the end of the second link is a tool, such as a drill. Such a robot would be used to drill a series of precisely positioned whole in a metal plate.\nEach link is moved by a digitally-controlled motor. To position the robot, commands are sent to the two motors to set their respective angles. For instance, in the diagram the motor-1 angle, \\(\\theta_1\\) is set to 45 degrees, while the motor-2 angle \\(\\theta_2\\) is set to -60 degrees.\nThe problem faced by the robot designer is to allow the user to input a series of \\((x,y)\\) coordinates (where the holes are to be drilled) and have the robot controller calculate the resulting angles.\nFor simplicity, assume that the link lengths are both \\(L = 1\\), but generalizing this to two different link lengths would not be difficult.\nAt this point, play with the problem a bit. Mark a point on your desk or paper. This will be the location of the base of the robot. Take two pencils, let’s call them “yellow” and “green,” putting the eraser of yellow at the base location and the eraser of green at the tip of yellow. Now, pick another point on your desk or paper to be the target for the robot arm. (This must be closer to the base than the sum of lengths of the two pencils.) Change the orientation of the pencils, keeping yellow attached to the base and green attached to the tip of yellow. Your job is to find an orientation that will place the tip of green on the target. Try different target points until you feel comfortable that you understand how to solve the problem.\nNow to create a mathematical model of the situation so that we can automate the solution. The purpose of this model is to find \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) given the \\((x, y)\\) position of the target.\nFrom your experience using pencils as the model of the robot, you may have noticed that the location of the “elbow” of the robot arm is key to the solution. Find the right position for the elbow and the angles can be calculated from trigonometry.\nNote that the position of the elbow, which we will denote with coordinates \\((u, v)\\) is determined solely by \\(L\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\).\n\nWrite down a formula for the \\(u\\) and for the \\(v\\) position of the elbow as a function of \\(\\theta_1\\) (taking the base as the origin). Hint: sine and cosine functions are relevant.\n\n  question id: snake-get-ring-1  2. Using Active R chunk 3, implement the formulas from (1) into two functions, one called elbow_u(theta1) and the other elbow_v(theta1).\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 3\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Active R chunk 4, write another function, elbow_to_target_dist(theta1, x, y) that will use elbow_u() and elbow_v() to calculate the distance from the elbow to the target point \\((x, y)\\). (The distance will be \\(\\sqrt{\\strut (x - u)^2 + (y-v)^2}\\).)\n\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 4\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nIn Active R chunk 5, write yet another function, dist_at_theta(theta1, x, y) that, given an angle theta, will return the distance from the elbow to the target. The logic is to use elbow_u() and elbow_v() to find the location of the elbow \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) and then give these as the argments to elbow_to_target_dist().\n\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 5\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nThe next phase of the solution is to use elbow_to_target_dist(theta1, x, y) to find a value of theta1 that will make the distance equal to the length \\(L\\) of link2. When you have found this theta1, you will know the position of the elbow that is consistent with reaching the target from the base with the two links.\n\nPick a target location. This can be anything within distance \\(2L\\) from the base. We will call the coordinates of your target target_x and target_y.\nPlot out elbow_to_target_dist(theta1, x=target_x, y=target_y) as a function of theta1 over the domain \\(-\\pi \\leq \\theta_1 \\leq  \\pi\\).\nLocate a value of \\(\\theta_1\\) where the output of the function is \\(L\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 6\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nWrite another function, elbow_theta1(x, y) that takes the \\((x, y)\\) position as input and produces as output suitable value(s) of \\(\\theta_1\\).

This is because to make an observation, Mars had to be visible from Earth on at least two occasions separated by the orbital period of Mars: 687 days. There were no observations when Mars wasn’t visible from Tycho Brahe’s observatory in Denmark, as happens whenever the line segment between Earth and Mars passes near the Sun.\nThe sinusoidal oscillation in the orbital radius of Mars reflects the eccentricy of the orbit; it is an ellipse rather than a circle. Neither the cubic spline nor the global polynomial do a creditable job tracking the actual orbit of Mars. That is because neither method has a way to “discover” that the data are periodic, which is a huge hint about the sorts of functions that are appropriate.\nNow, a trick. We will compute for each time a phase of that time in the 687 day orbit. This will collapse all the data down to the interval \\(0 \\leq t &lt; 687\\).

These are called knot points; the points the interpolator is bound to go through.\nThere are three types of interpolating functions on offer:\n\nA piecewise-linear interpolator, which merely connects the knots with straight-line segments.\nA cubic-spline interpolator, which is for good reason the most widely used in practice.\nA global polynomial interpolator. For \\(n\\) knots, an \\(n-1\\) order polynomial suffices to connect the dots smoothly.\n\nPressing “Start again” generates a new set of knots. You can also select the number of knots to use.\nThe top graphic shows the knot points and any of the interpolators you have chosen to display.\nThe middle graph shows the first derivative with respect to \\(x\\) of the interpolating functions. The last graph (if displayed) shows the 2nd derivative with respect to \\(x\\).\nThere is also a control that allows you to narrow the region of display to exclude the first and last of the knots. All the knots are still being used to construct the interpolants, but only the middle segment of the interpolants is displayed.\nWhen you start the app, five randomly generated knots are shown together with the straight-line interpolating function.\n\nTrue or False: The segments of the straight-line interpolator never go beyond the vertical interval defined by the two knots being connected.\n\n\n TRUE        FALSE       \n\nquestion id: giraffe-dig-radio-1\n\n\n\nAll of these terms, except one, describe the first derivative (with respect to \\(x\\)) of the straight-line interpolant.

Your task is to re-arrange the endpoints and control points to create a single stroke that resembles the lower-case character “e”.

Sleep!\n\n\n\nquestion id: snake-walk-knife-9\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7 We’d like to make a folded cardboard box in the most efficient way possible. As you know, cardboard boxes have four sides as well as eight flaps, four for the top and four for the bottom. The flaps are arranged to provide double coverage; you fold the flaps from one direction and then fold over them the flaps from the other direction.\n\nThe diagram depicts the box sides and flaps laid out on a flat piece of cardboard. The flaps are shaded with diagonal lines.\nSuppose the height, width, and depth of the box are \\(h\\), \\(w\\), and \\(d\\) respectively. The box volume is easy:\n\\[V = h w d\\] The area of cardboard consists of the the four sides and the eight flaps. Each component’s area is a product of the two edge lengths. For example, the box sides are either \\(w h\\) or \\(d h\\). The flaps, each of which extends half-way across the bottom or top have areas \\(w d/2\\).\n\nWhich of these formulas gives the area of the cardboard making up the box?\n\n\n\n \\(2 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(4 h(w + d) + 2 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 h(w + d) + 8 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(4 h(w + d) + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-1\n\n\nA common size for a box is 1.3 cubic feet. We will use feet as the units for \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\).\n\nThe following formulas do not describe the area of the cardboard, but they are nonetheless formulas for something. Except one of them, which cannot be true. Which one? (Hint: Think about dimension.)\n\n\n\n \\(h(w + d)/d + w d^2/h\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w + d) + w h d\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w + d) + w^2 h/d\\)\n\n\n \\(h(w^2/d + d) + d^2\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-2\n\n\nAs \\(w\\), \\(h\\), or \\(d\\) are changed, the volume and surface area of the box are changed. Asking for the \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\) that minimize the surface area of the box is not a complete statement of a problem. The minimum surface area will be zero whenever two of the three dimensions have length zero. In other words, we can minimize the surface area by making a box that is no box at all!\nTo complete the problem statement we need something else. Here, that something is a constraint: We demand that the box have a volume of \\(V = 1.3\\) cubic feet.\nOften, a constraint plays the role of a dimension reduction. With \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(d\\), we have a 3-input optimization problem. But we can use the constraint equation to solve for one of the variables as a function of the other quantities and the (known) volume. For instance, we can find \\(h\\) as \\[h = V/d w\\]\n\nPlug in the above expression for \\(h\\) into the formula for the surface area of cardboard. Which of the following is the resulting formula in terms of \\(w\\), \\(d\\), and \\(V\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(2 V(w + d)/wd + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(V(w + d)/w + V(w+d)/d  + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 w d (w + d)/V + 4 w d\\)\n\n\n \\(2 (w + d)/wd + 4 V w d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-3\n\n\nActive R chunk 1 contains the formula for the surface area \\(A(w, d, V)\\) of a box of volume \\(V\\). The graphics command draws a contour plot of \\(A()\\) as a function of \\(w\\) and \\(d\\), holding \\(V = 1.3\\) cubic feet.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nThere is a broad area near the center inside the contour at area = 9.5. Towards the upper-right and lower-left corners of the plot frame are contours at higher levels of area.\n\nThe spacing between the contours in the corners is tight, but there is no similarly spaced contour inside the region delimited by the contour at area=9.5. Why not?\n\n\n\n We didn’t ask for contours inside 9.5.\n\n\n The function shape inside the 9.5 contour is the top of a bowl, so it is pretty flat.\n\n\n The function shape inside the 9.5 contour is the bottom of a bowl, so it is pretty flat.\n\n\n All the points inside the 9.5 contour are at the same height.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-4\n\n\nUse Active R chunk 1 to place contours at 10, 9.5, 9.4. You can do this by replacing the argument contours_at = NULL with this:\ncontours_at = c(10, 9.5, 9.4))\nAdd more contours to build a fence tighter and tighter around the argmin. When the fenced region is tiny, you can read off the min from the contour label. (Remember, the “argmin” is the value of the inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) at which the function is minimized. The “min” is the value of the function at the argmin.) But watch out as you do this. If you ask for a contour at a level that is lower than the min, it will simply not be drawn. Or, more precisely, there are no inputs that produce an output that is lower than the min. So you may have to change the interval between levels (e.g. 10, 9.5, 9.4, …) to home in on the argmin.\n\nThe following are values for the output of the function where you might be able to draw a contour. Which one of the values is the smallest for which a contour appears?\n\n\n\n 9.1\n\n\n 9.05\n\n\n 9.01\n\n\n 9.005\n\n\n 9.0005\n\n\n 9\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-5\n\n\n\nFrom your contour plot, read off the values of \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) that produce the minimum surface area for a 1.3 cubic-foot box. What are they? (Hint: You may need to zoom in on the domain to get the precision needed to answer the question.)\n\n\n\n \\(w \\approx 0.9; d\\approx 0.9\\)\n\n\n \\(w \\approx 0.9; d\\approx 0.6\\)\n\n\n \\(w \\approx 0.5; d\\approx 0.9\\)\n\n\n \\(w \\approx 1.9; d\\approx 0.9\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-6\n\n\nIt is easy enough for a person to look at a contour plot and roughly locate the argmin. But this is not feasible if there are more than two inputs to the function being optimized. For such functions, another set of numerical techniques are used based on the gradient of the objective function. Remember that the gradient at any point is a vector that points in the uphill direction and whose length is proportional to the steepness of the slope. (Skiers, beware. In skiing what people call the gradient is the steepest downhill direction. This might account for all the mathematicians learning to ski who point their skis uphill in response to the ski instructor’s instruction!)\nYou can display the gradient on the plot of the area function by piping (remember %&gt;%) the contour plot into the commented-out command in the sandbox. (Also, replace # pipe to with %&gt;%.)\n\nWhich of these best describes the gradient vector at the argmin?\n\n\n\n The gradient points due North.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is maximal.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is minimal.\n\n\n The length of the gradient vector is zero.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-7\n\n\nOccasionally, particularly in textbook problems, the argmin or argmax is found algebraically. This still involves calculating the gradient, which will be a function of the input quantities. Then, find the inputs that make all the components of the gradient vector zero.\n\nWhich of these formulas give the gradient vector of \\(A(w, d)\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 w\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2}+ 4 d, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2} - 4 w\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{w^2}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d^2} - 4 d\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_w A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w}+ 4 w, \\ \\ \\partial_d A = -2 \\frac{V}{d w} - 4 d\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-8\n\n\n\nIf the lengths \\(w\\), \\(d\\), \\(h\\) are measured in feet, what unit will \\(\\partial_w A\\) be in?\n\n\n\n feet\n\n\n square feet\n\n\n cubic feet\n\n\n 1/feet\n\n\n dimensionless\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-9\n\n\nFor those of you who are pining for algebra problems, here you go.\nTaking the gradient of \\(A(w, d)\\) (given in a previous question), set both components to zero, giving you two equations in the two quantities \\(w\\) and \\(d\\). There is also a \\(V\\) in the equations, but we’ve set up the problem saying that we already know \\(V\\). Numerically, we used \\(V=1.3\\) cubic-feet, but in the algebra solution we can just leave \\(V\\) as a symbol, giving general formulas for \\(w\\) and for \\(d\\) in terms of \\(V\\).\n\nWhich of these is the correct formula for the optimal \\(w^\\star\\) as a function of \\(V\\)? (Hint: You can weed out one of the choices by checking for dimensional consistency.)\n\n\n\n \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{V}}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\)\n\n\n \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{V}}{\\sqrt[3]{3}}\\)\n\n\n \\(w^\\star = \\frac{\\sqrt[2]{V}}{\\sqrt[2]{3}}\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-10\n\n\nThe solution for \\(d^\\star\\) is the same as for \\(w^\\star\\). (An experienced algebraist would have noticed that in the formula for area, you can swap inputs \\(w\\) and \\(d\\) without changing the output.)\nNow compute the formula for the optimal value \\(h^\\star\\). (Hint: Early in the section we gave a formula that involves \\(V\\), \\(h\\), \\(w\\), and \\(d\\).)\n\nWhich of these is the correct formula for the optimal \\(h^\\star\\) as a function of \\(V\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(h^\\star = 2^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n \\(h^\\star =  2^{1/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n \\(h^\\star =  3^{2/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n \\(h^\\star =  3^{1/3} \\sqrt[3]{V}\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-11\n\n\nIt turns out that \\(h^\\star\\) is somewhat larger than either \\(w^\\star\\) or \\(d^\\star\\); the optimal box has a square top and bottom, but the sides are not square.\n\nWhich of these is an appropriate explanation for why \\(h^\\star\\) is larger than \\(w^\\star\\) or \\(d^\\star\\)?\n\n\n\n People don’t like using boxes that are perfect cubes.\n\n\n \\(h\\) multiplies both \\(w\\) and \\(d\\), but not vice versa, in the formula for surface area.\n\n\n The flaps need to get longer as \\(h\\) gets longer, so smaller \\(h\\) helps to minimize the amount of cardboard.\n\n\n The flap-length does not depend on \\(h\\), only on \\(w d\\). So we can make \\(h\\) larger without contributing to the “wasted” area of the doubling over of flaps. The flaps get smaller as \\(wd\\) gets smaller, so larger \\(h\\) is preferred.\n\n\n\nquestion id: duck-tell-laundry-12\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8 In this exercise, you will work with an optimization problem. First, we will ask about a mathematical solution to the problem. Next, we will show that the mathematical solution is not necessarily the best real-world solution because of multiple objectives in decision making. Then we will show you a real-world decision-making rubric that is widely accepted, at least among people who listen to the whole story with an open mind.\nThe graph shows the estimated number of lives saved by three different health-care related interventions – A, B, C – as a function of the amount of money spent on each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have $1,000,000,000 to spend altogether on these interventions. Your policy alternatives are all the different combinations of spending on (A), (B), and (C) that add up to $1B (or less).\nHow should you split up the money among the interventions? For example, we could spend $125M on B, $125M on C, and $750M on A. This would save an estimated 346 lives. Can we do better?\nImagine that we use \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) to denote expenditure, with \\(x\\) spent on intervention A, \\(y\\) on intervention B, and \\(z\\) on intervention C. Altogether, the budget is \\(x + y + z = \\$1B\\).\n\nSuppose \\(x = 750\\), \\(y = 125\\), and \\(z=125\\), where units are millions of dollars. It is suggested that reducing \\(x\\) by $1M to increase \\(z\\) by that amount will produce a better outcome in terms of the total number of lives saved. That is, move some money from intervention A to intervention C. Is this suggestion correct? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n Not correct. The number of lives saved by spending $750M on A is larger than the number that would be saved by spending that much on B or C.\n\n\n Not correct. We will want to move the money to B instead.\n\n\n Correct. The derivative \\(\\partial_x A(x)\\) at \\(x=750\\) is smaller than the derivative \\(\\partial_z C(z)\\) at \\(z=125\\).\n\n\n Correct. We should spend equally on all three interventions. That is, set \\(x = y = z = 333.33....\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: tp1-1\n\n\nA general principle is this: If spending a little more on one intervention increases the output more than the loss due to spending less on another intervention, the shift in funding is worthwhile.\n. If you follow the above logic, you will continue to move money from A to C until it is no longer beneficial to do so. What will be the maximum amount of spending on A makes it not worthwhile to move additional money from A to C? (Choose the closest answer.)\n\n\n $ 250M\n\n\n $ 375M\n\n\n $ 500M\n\n\n $ 625M\n\n\n\nquestion id: tpt1-2\n\n\n\nImagine that you have moved all the money from A to C that it is worthwhile to do . Which of these statements is true at those values \\(x_0\\), \\(z_0\\)?\n\n\n\n \\(\\partial_x A(x_0) = \\partial_z C(z_0)\\)\n\n\n \\(A(x_0) = C(z_0)\\)\n\n\n \\(C(x_0) = A(z_0)\\)\n\n\n \\(\\partial_x A(x_0) = 0\\) and \\(\\partial_z C(z_0) = 0\\).\n\n\n\nquestion id: tpt1-3\n\n\nWe found it worthwhile to move expenditure from A to C to optimize the sum of their outputs and are operating at about \\(x_0 = \\$500M\\) and \\(z_0 = \\$375M\\), leaving \\(y=\\$125M\\) to spend on intervention B. Is it worthwhile to move money from A or C to B or vice versa? But first, a simpler question.\n\nIf we were going to move a small amount of money from A or C into B, would it be better to take the money from A or from C? Why?\n\n\n\n Take it from A, since we are spending far more on A than C.\n\n\n Take it from C, since we are already spending far less on C than on A.\n\n\n Take it from C. The slope \\(\\partial_z C(z_0)\\) compared to \\(\\partial_x A(z_0)\\) is such that a small reduction on spending on C has less impact than a small reduction in spending on A.\n\n\n Take it from A. The slope \\(\\partial_z C(z_0)\\) compared to \\(\\partial_x A(z_0)\\) is such that a small reduction on spending on A has less impact than a small reduction in spending on C.\n\n\n\nquestion id: tpt1-4\n\n\n\nRight now in our process, we are planning to spend $125M on B. Is it worthwhile to move money from C to B?\n\n\n\n No, the output of B larger than the output of C at $125M.\n\n\n Yes, move most of the money from C to B.\n\n\n Yes, but only move a little money from C to B.\n\n\n No, move money from B to C.\n\n\n\nquestion id: tpt1-5\n\n\n\nAt the optimal amount of money \\(y^\\star\\) spent on B and \\(z^\\star\\) spent on C, which of these is true about the slopes \\(\\partial_y B(y^\\star)\\) and \\(\\partial_z C(z^\\star)\\)?\n\n\n\n There is not any fixed relationship. They are what they are.\n\n\n The two slopes are equal.\n\n\n The slope of B is greater than the slope of C.\n\n\n The slope of C is greater than the slope of B.\n\n\n\nquestion id: tpt1-6\n\n\n\nIs it more proper to say the “slope \\(\\partial_z C(z^\\star)\\)” rather than the “derivative \\(\\partial_z C(z^\\star)\\)?” (This is a general review problem for the course, not something specifically about optimization.)\n\n\n\n Yes. A derivative is a function while a slope is a quantity.\n\n\n No. Slope and derivative are the same thing.\n\n\n Yes. “Derivative” sounds fancier than “slope”.\n\n\n No. Slopes measure steepness from right to left, while derivatives give steepness from left to right.\n\n\n\nquestion id: tpt1-7\n\n\nBackground: The graphs are fictitious, but let’s pretend they are:\n\nA Surgical treatment of congenital heart defects in newborns.\nB Treatment for hemophilia.\nC Memory-care for people with Alzheimers.\n\nNotice that the people being affected are in different, non-overlapping groups. So moving funding from one group to another is effectively “robbing Peter to pay Paul.” If you, as a decision maker inherited a situation where \\(x = \\$750M\\), \\(y=\\$125M\\), and \\(z=\\$125M\\), changing the expenditures would make one group better off (no matter how you did it!) and would make another group worse off. And imagine the headlines if you moved money from A to C or B: “Government slashes funding for newborns!”. Or perhaps an editorial: “We need to find a way to increase funding for hemophilia without cutting other life-saving spending.” This raises an important question: Is it ever worthwhile to forgo spending to save lives? How would anyone decide which lives are worth saving? Most people are uncomfortable with such questions. Yet the decisions taken by leaders, whatever they be, inevitably have a mathematically equivalent formulation which translates to the value of life.\nProbably, most people would decline to make a decision comparing two lives, for instance, saving a 10-year old versus saving a 90-year old. But it is not always possible to escape such trade-offs and the people who need to take the decision need guidance about what to do. In an open society, we expect such decisions to be backed by good rationale and so we have to develop means for distinguishing between better and worse rationales.\nOne example comes from epidemiology and the concept of a “quality-adjusted life year” (QALY). A QALY is a measure of duration of life adjusted for the health condition of the person — a year of a person in good health is 1 QALY, but a year in a person in very poor health is less than 1 QALY.\nQALYs do not solve the problem of optimizing health-related outcomes. They are an imperfect means of dealing with an impossible problem. Sometimes that is the best we can do.\n\n\nExercise 10  \n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou are a member of a health-care oversight committee that allocates funds for investment in health-care facilities. The committee has two proposal before it and needs to decide how best to spend the available $50M budget:\n\nProposal A: Expansion of the pediatric organ transplant unit.\nProposal B: Creation of a new rehabilitation center for traumatic injury patients.\n\nExperts have evaluated each proposal in terms of different cost options and the impact that each will have on health outcomes. Following a standard epidemiological method, the impact is estimated in terms of “Quality Adjusted Life-Years” (QALY), a measure that combines the number of people affected, the number of years of prolonged life, and the improvement in quality of life for those treated.\nThe expert estimates are available in the data frame QALY_impact:\nQALY Impact of the Proposals\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSuch estimates from experts should be taken with a grain of salt, but they are often the best information you have to inform a model.\nYou can turn the expert’s opinions into functions by using splines. In this case, there is good reason to think that output will increase monotonically with expenditure, so a monotonic spline is a good choice.

One way to examine this is to look at how the QALY outcome changes as the budget changes.\nFor this, we will find values of \\(x_A\\) and \\(x_B\\) at which the derivatives \\(\\partial_{x_A} f_A()\\) and \\(\\partial_{x_B} f_B()\\) are equal.\nThe following graphic shows the difference \\(\\partial_{x_A} f_A() - \\partial_{x_B} f_B()\\) as a function of \\(x_A\\) and \\(x_B\\). The contours are very twisty, but the zero contour(s) indicates the inputs for which the difference in derivatives is zero. Also shown are budget constraints (magenta).\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 5\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYet another constraint!\n\nThe American Association of Allergy Activists (AAAA) has lobbied Congress to mandate that, of the 50 units of available funds, funding for A must be \\(x_A \\geq 40\\). How much would this constraint reduce the overall output for the two interventions combined? (Remember, if you’re spending, say, 45 on A, you cannot spend more than the remaining 5 on B.) The challenge for you in answering this question is to pick the appropriate one of the above graphs. Once you have done that, the answer is evident.\n\n\n\n No reduction at all.\n\n\n About 10-20 QALYs.\n\n\n About 40-60 QALYs.\n\n\n About 100-120 QALYs.\n\n\n It would increase the output.\n\n\n\nquestion id: crow-trim-laundry-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 9 The figure shows the path(s) of a ray of light traveling through three layers of an optical medium. Each layer has a different index of refraction, which reflects the speed of light in that medium compared light traveling in empty space.\n\nAt each interface between media with differing indices of refraction, the light is reflected. The proportion of light reflected at the interface 0-1 is \\[R_{0,1} = \\left(\\frac{n_0-n_1}{n_0+n_1}\\right)^2\\ .\\]\nSimilarly, at interface 1-2, a fraction \\[R_{1,2} = \\left(\\frac{n_1-n_2}{n_1+n_2}\\right)^2\\ .\\]\nThe total amount reflected in passing through both layers is approximately $R_{0,1} \\(\\times\\) R_{1,2}$.\nThe point of sandwiching optical elements in this way is to reduce reflection (or, equivalently, increase the transmission of light). Correspondingly, we will call the \\(n_1\\) layer an anti-reflection layer. Special materials are selected for such layers to minimize reflection.\nSuppose that the indices of fraction \\(n_0 = 1\\) and \\(n_2 = 2\\).\n\nWhat is the optimal value of \\(n_1\\) (argmax) in the anti-reflective layer to minimize the total reflection of light passing from the left optical element into the right optical element? What proportion of light is reflected at that argmax?\nSuppose that there were no anti-reflective layer, that is, the \\(n_0\\) element abutted directly on the \\(n_2\\) region. What fraction of light would be reflected then?\nThere can be more than one anti-reflective layer. Imagine that the \\(n_1\\) layer were replaced with two layers, which we will call \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), with indices of refraction \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_B\\).\n\nWhat are the optimal values for \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_B\\) to maximize transmission from the \\(n_0\\) medium to the \\(n_1\\) medium?\nCan the two-layer scheme improve transmission compaared to the 1-layer scheme?\n\n\n\n49-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

The nliving variable is computed by tracking the age-specific mortality rate as it plays out in a hypothetical population of 100,000 newborns. The age-specific mortality rate at age 0 is applied the the 100,000 to calculate the number of deaths in the first year: 531. Therefore 99,469 survive to age 1. Then the age-specific mortality rate at age 1 is applied to the 99,469 survivors to calculate the number of deaths of one-year olds: 34. This leaves 99,434 surviving two-year olds.

Of course that means there is 36.8% chance that the event will happen after the 100 day mark. If the event does not happen in the first 100 days, there is a 63.2% chance that it will happen in interval 100-200 days. Similarly, if the event does not happen in the first 200 days, there is a 63.2% chance that it will happen in interval 200-300 days.

Many people mis-understand “life expectancy at birth” to mean that people will die mainly around 81 years of age. That is not quite so. People who are approaching 81 should keep in mind that they likely have additional years of life. A good way to quantify this is with the life-expectancy at age 81. We can calculate life-expectancy at 81 based on the prob_death60().

For instance, for the week of April 7, 2021, the jackpot payout was officially described as $43,000,000. But they don’t really mean this.\nAfter withholding taxes, the supposed $43,000,000 amounts to $17,161,778 as a one time cash payment, or, alternatively, 30 annual payments of $873,711. (The tax numbers are for Colorado.) We want to find the discount rate that is implicit in the equating of $17M now with 30 payments of $875,000.\nDiscounted at a continuously compounded rate of \\(k\\), the net present value of a 30-year payment stream of $875K per year is \\[\\text{NPV}(k) = \\int_0^{30} e^{-kt}\\ \\$875000\\, dt\\ .\\]\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 1\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate this definite integral symbolically to find a formula for NPV\\((k)\\).\n\n\n\nUsing Active R chunk 1, implement the function NPV\\((k)\\) in R.\n\n\nSolve for \\(k_0\\) that gives NPV\\((k_0) = \\$17,000,000\\).\n\n\nTranslate the continuously compounded interest rate \\(k\\) into the corresponding 1-year compounded interest rate \\(r\\).\n\nThere is a joke that makes sense only to the financially savvy: When the Powerball claims a $1 million payout, they mean $1 per year over a million years. We can do this calculation using the symbolic formula for NPV(t) but replacing the $875,000 with $1 and the 30 years upper limit of the integral with 1,000,000 years.\n\nSet the discount rate to the \\(k_0\\) you found in step (3) and calculate the net present value of $1 per year for a million years.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 In this exercise, you will calculate the net present value of the social security payments for a woman retiring at age 70. We will assume that benefits are paid at a rate of $24,000 per year.\nThe R/mosaic commands in Active R chunk 2 will construct a function, survive(age) that gives the proportion of people alive at age 70 who will survive to an older age.

Of course, it is not known ahead of time when a retiree will die, but the survive(age) function gives a probability of surviving to any given age.\n\nModify the integral to incorporate the survival probability into the net present value calculation. That is, calculate the expectation value of the net present value.\n\nIs survive(age) a probability density function? Explain why or why not.\n\n  question id: octopus-toss-gloves-3  \n\n\nExercise 3 We have records of large earthquakes going back 1000’s of years, at least in those parts of the world that kept written records. In regions with mainly oral traditions, stories of historical earthquakes are treated with skepticism.\nFor instance, in California written records reach about 400 years into the past. Anticipating a future earthquakes is an everyday matter in California and governments in seismically active zones have prepared by means of building codes and emergency precautions. A bit further up the US West Coast, in the Cascadia region of Oregon, there is a shorter written record and, until the last 30-40 years, little realization that the area has been subject to profoundly powerful earthquakes called “great quakes.” There are great quakes in living memory: the 2004 Boxing Day earthquake centered on Sumatra that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan that killed tens of thousands and led to the meltdown of nuclear power plants in Fukashima. Both of these were magnitude 9.1. Even larger were the 1964 9.2 magnitude quake in southern Alaska and the magnitude 9.5 Valdivia earthquake in Chile in 1960. The local magnitude scale is logarithmic, so a 9.5 magnitude quake releases about 3 times the energy of a 9.1 magnitude quake.\nThis exercise explores a model to inform the extent to which it is worth preparing for such quakes to prevent material damage. The risk to life is another important matter. But feasible investments in the build environment can minimize the direct impact of earthquakes to human life. Tsunamis generated by quakes are another matter, for which the only effective mitigating precautions are the development of evacuation routes and procedures and relocation of building away from the affected zone.\nLet’s imagine a situation in which $100 spent in precautions such as strengthening building construction would generate $1000 in savings in the event of a major earthquake. (This ratio is made up for demonstration purposes, but you can easily substitute a better substantiated estimate.) From a societal point of view, many people would see the investment as worthwhile. But we will take a more technical point of view that incorporates two factors:\n\nThe $100 is to be spent today, while the $1000 savings will occur in the future. This can be handled by simple discounting.\nThe time until the earthquake is unknown, although reasonable probability models are available.\n\nThe time of the last great Cascadia Zone earthquake is known with surprising precision: January 26, 1700. Before this, dates are estimated from geologic evidence. The figure shows the known history of Cascadia Zone earthquakes. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Records of the Cascadia Zone earthquakes. Source\n\n\n\nA standard model for the interval between earthquakes of a given magnitude is the exponential distribution. For the great quakes in the Cascadia Zone, the average interval between consecutive quakes is about 300 years and the corresponding exponential probability distribution is \\[\\frac{e^{t/300}}{300}\\] The sandbox is set up to make a graph of this distribution and enables other calculations you will need later.\nAs shown by the definite integral already coded in Active R chunk 3, the total probability of an earthquake at some point in the future is, according to the model, 100%. So this is a model of when an earthquake will occur, not whether one will occur.\n\n\n\nActive R chunk 3\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nAlmost everyone who meets the exponential probability model is surprised that the density is highest at time \\(t=0^+\\), that is, immediately after the previous quake.\n\nBy using the appropriate definite integral, find the probability for earthquakes separated on average by 300 years (this essentially means using the provided model in the code) that the actual interval from the last quake will be less than 30 years. Which percentage is closest?\n\n\n 2%        10%        20%        25%       \n\nquestion id: kangaroo-find-magnet-1\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the previous question, find the probability that the actual interval from the last quake will be more than 500 years. (Hint: Be thoughful about what the limits of integration will be.)\n\n\n 2%        10%        20%        25%       \n\nquestion id: kangaroo-find-magnet-2\n\n\nAn astounding and counter-intuitive aspect of the exponential model is that the same probability density describes the time from now to the eventual earthquake. In other words, it does not matter how long it has been since the last earthquake.\nNow let’s put together our model of the net present value of an expenditure on earthquake preparedness. As you recall, the net present value of \\(\\$10\\) to be paid \\(t\\) years from the present is \\(10 e^{-r t}\\), where \\(r\\) is the continuously compounded interest rate. For the example, we will set \\(r=7.8\\%\\), as we did in the Powerball example.\nOf course \\(t\\) is uncertain, so there is no definite answer for the net present value of earthquake preparedness. However, since we have a model of the probability of the earthquake occuring as a function of the interval \\(t\\), we can find the expectation value of the net present value of earthquake preparedness.\nFor continuous probability densities (such as the exponential earthquake interval model) an expectation value is the definite integral over all possibilities of the probability density times the eventual outcome.\n\nUsing the information presented above about the probability density function and the net present value, which of the following is appropriate for calculation of the net present value of $10 spent today for earthquake preparedness?\n\n\n\n \\(\\frac{100}{300} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-0.078 t} e^{-t/300}dt\\)\n\n\n \\(\\frac{10}{300} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-1.078 t} e^{-t/300}dt\\)\n\n\n \\(100 \\int_{0}^{300} e^{-1.078 t} e^{-t/300}dt\\)\n\n\n \\(\\frac{100}{300} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-7.8 t} e^{-t/300}dt\\)\n\n\n\nquestion id: kangaroo-find-magnet-3\n\n\nThe integral gives only the net present value of the eventual benefit of earthquake preparedness. If this is larger than today’s expenditure, the expenditure is economically worthwhile.\n\nWhat is the numerical value (in dollars) of the correct integral from the previous question?\n\n\n 0.43        4.10        14.80        34.50       \n\nquestion id: kangaroo-find-magnet-4\n\n\nWHAT SHOULD THE DISCOUNT RATE BE IF YOU BELIEVE THE SAFETY MEASURES ARE WORTHWHILE?\nWe used an average time between earthquakes of 300 years, as seem appropriate for the Cascadia Zone earthquake history. The net present value of the eventual reduction in damages was small, too small to justify the expenditure on economic grounds.\nModify the code in the above sandbox to perform the calculation for different earthquakes, say with an average interval of 50 years or 100 years.\n\n\n5. What's the longest average interval that generates a net present value of the damage reduction of $\\$10$, enough to justify the expenditure? Pick the closest one. (Hint: You can try out expectation value integral using the average intervals given as choices in place of the 300-year interval originally used.)\n\n```{mcq}\n#| label: kangaroo-find-magnet-5\n#| show_hints: true\n1. 25 years \n2. 50 years [ correct hint: right-o  ]\n3. 100 years \n4. 150 years \n```\n\n\nWARNING. You should not come away from this exercise with the idea that \\(r = 0.078\\) is the “right” discount rate. We used that rate in this exercise only because there is documented evidence that some group of people—the sorts of investors who buy 30-year TIPS—currently act as if that were their discount rate. An individual is entitled to set his or her own discount rate based on any rationale whatsoever. (That said, the interest rate you could make long term on an investment readily available to you can reasonably be taken as the baseline.)\nWhen it comes to groups of people, the appropriate discount rate becomes a matter of opinion and disagreement. In particular, there is a concept called the “social discount rate”. Regretably, there is no clear basis for picking this other than to put it in the range 0 to about 7%. Net present value is therefore a dubious criterion for making decisions whose impact will be felt in the long term, over generations. This is the case, for instance, with global warmi\n\n\nActivities\n\nExercise 4 The mathematician’s preferred format for discounting functions is \\(e^{kt}\\), while the banker’s is \\((1+r)^{-t}\\).\nDerive an expression for \\(k\\) in terms of \\(r\\) so that the mathematician’s and banker’s forms are completely equivalent.\nUse the computer to confirm your expression by plotting out both \\((1+r)^{-t}\\) and \\(e^{kt}\\), with \\(k\\) set according to your expression.

Use linear axes, semi-log axes, or log-log axes to determine a reasonable functional form.

Life expectancy depends on many factors other than health care: nutrition, war, automobile safety, etc.\nNotice from the data that the countries with the highest life expectancies are those where \\(D  \\approx 3\\). And yet, there are many countries with \\(D \\approx 3\\) that have relatively low life expectancy. One reason for this is inequality. In many countries, urbanites live at a high standard and people in the countryside have very little access to health care or reliably good nutrition, civil order, and so on.\n\n51-exercises.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",

People are understandably skeptical that an automated system can cope with all the varying conditions of traffic, visibility, road damage, etc. without the benefit of human judgment or experience. For this reason, society will need to accumulate substantial evidence for enhanced safety in self-driving cars before accepting any claims to that effect.\nThis project is about how to accumulate such evidence.\nBased on experience with tens of millions of regular cars driving hundreds of billions of total miles, suppose we decide the accident probability is approximately 10% per 20,000 miles. Note that this is not stating that an accident is certain to occur in the first 200,000 miles of driving. The probability that, for a representative car, an accident occurs at \\(m\\) miles will have an exponential shape \\(g(m, k)\\) where \\[g(m, D) \\equiv \\frac{1}{D} e^{-m/D}\\, .\\] Consequently, an accident might happen in the first few miles or at 300,000 miles or not at all within the lifetime of the car.\nTake note that we have parameterized the exponential with \\(D\\), which will have units of miles. Thus, bigger \\(D\\) means a safer car. You can think about \\(D\\) as indicating the distance traveled by a typical car before it has an accident.\nPart A. Estimate the \\(D\\) to be consistent with the idea that there is a 10% chance of an accident at or before the first \\(m=20,000\\) miles of driving.\n\nRecognize that “at or before” corresponds to a cumulative probability function which in this case will be \\[\\int_0^m \\frac{1}{D} e^{- x/D}\\, dx\\ .\\]\nConstruct the cumulative probability density in symbolic form. It will be a function of both \\(D\\) and \\(m\\), let’s call it \\(G(m, D)\\).  (Hint: \\(G(0, D)\\) must be zero. \\(G(m, D)\\) will have a roughly sigmoid increase with \\(m\\). \\(\\lim_{m \\rightarrow \\infty} G(m, D) = 1\\).)\nSet \\(G(m=20000, D_0) = 0.10\\), per our assumption for ordinary cars of a 10% risk in \\(m=20,000\\) miles of driving. Solve this to find \\(D_0\\). \n\nShow your work.\nTo start the calculations, we will need a prior relative density function for \\(k\\). We are hopeful but skeptical about self-driving cars. The best case scenario, let’s say, is that the self-driving cars will be 10 times safer than regular cars. The worst case is that they will be 10 times worse. Using \\(k\\) as our measure of safety, we will set our prior to have the form \\(1/D\\).\nPart B: Implement the function \\(\\text{prior}(D) = 1/D\\).\n\nGraph out \\(\\text{prior}(D)\\) on the domain 2,000 to 2,000,000, that is, roughly \\(D_0/10\\) to \\(10 D_0\\).\nReferring to your graph, write down your intuition about whether this prior seems to favor \\(D &lt; D_0\\) or not.\nNow remember that \\(\\text{prior}(D)\\) shows relative density. So compare the total probability that \\(D_0/10 \\leq D \\leq D_0\\) to the probability of \\(D_0 \\leq D \\leq 10 D_0\\) \\[\\int_{20,000}^{200,000} \\text{prior}(D)\\, dD\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{to}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\int_{200,000}^{2,000,000} \\text{prior}(D)\\, dD\\ .\\] Does this indicate that the \\(1/D\\) prior is biased toward the assumption that self-driving cars will be no safer than ordinary cars? Explain your reasoning.\n\nNow imagine that you work for a safety organization collecting accident information. To figure out the safety of self-driving cars, you are monitoring a fleet of 100 self-driving cars. Each year you get a report giving the odometer reading of the car, or, if the car has been in an accident that year, the odometer reading at the time of the accident. The data might look like the following table. (The table is entirely fictitious and shouldn’t be misinterpreted as representing real-world self-driving cars.):\n\n\n\ncar \\(i\\)\nStatus\nMileage\n\n\n\n\n1\non road\n85,300\n\n\n2\non road\n65,200\n\n\n3\naccident\n13,495\n\n\n4\non road\n131,200\n\n\n5\non road\n96,000\n\n\n6\naccident\n54,682\n\n\n7\naccident\n105,200\n\n\n8\non road\n53,900\n\n\n9\naccident\n86,000\n\n\n10\non road\n94,300\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n100\non road\n107,200\n\n\n\nThe first two cars in the fleet have accumulated 85,300 and 65,200 accident-free miles respectively. The third car was in an accident at 13,495 miles and is no longer on the road.\nIn response to the data, you issue a yearly report in the form of a posterior distribution on \\(D\\), our measure of safety.\nTo update the original prior into a posterior, you need to construct the likelihood functions. There are two functions, because there are two different kinds of observations on each car:\n\nIf the car was in an accident, then you want the likelihood of \\(D\\) given the mileage at which the accident happened. Since the probability model is \\(\\frac{1}{D}\\, e^{-D\\, m}\\), the likelihood function for a car that had an accident at \\(m_\\text{accident}\\) miles will be \\(\\frac{1}{D}\\, e^{-D\\, m_\\text{accident}}\\).\nIf the car has not been in an accident, then you want the likelihood of \\(D\\) given the number of miles traveled.\n\nThe likelihood function (b) is based on the probability model that the car has not had an accident in \\(m_\\text{driven}\\) miles of driving. Recall that the cumulative probability, \\(G(m, D)\\) in part A of this exercise, is the probability that the car did have an accident at or before \\(m\\) miles of driving. So the probability that the car did not have an accident in that amount of driving is \\(1 - G(m, D)\\). The likelihood function will therefore be \\(1 - G(m_\\text{driven}, D)\\).\nPart C. Implement the two likelihood functions in R as Laccident(m, D) and Lno(m D).\nPlot out the two functions and explain why their shape makes sense. Show the code that implements the two functions.\nNow you are in a position to update the prior to create the posterior probability density on \\(D\\) given the data at hand. As always with Bayesian inference, the posterior will be: \\[\\text{posterior}(D) = \\frac{1}{A} \\prod_\\text{cars}\\text{likelihood}_i(D | \\text{miles}_i) \\text{prior}(D)\\] where \\(\\text{likelihood}_i()\\) refers to whichever one of the two likelihood functions in Part C is relevant to car \\(i\\) and \\(\\text{miles}_i\\) is the observed mileage for that car. The constant \\(A\\) is selected to normalize the posterior probability density.\nPart D. To keep things simple, we will use just the first 10 cars in the fleet report. The unnormalized posterior function will be:\n\npost &lt;- function(D) {\n  Lno(85300, D) * Lno(65200, D) * \n  Laccident(13495, D) * Lno(131200, D) *  \n  #similarly for each of the remaining cars ...\n  prior(D)\n}    \n\nBased on the data from the first 10 cars, do you think that the self-driving cars are safer than the ordinary cars? Recall that \\(D_0\\), calculated above, represents the safety of ordinary cars.\n\nBlock-6-models.rmarkdown Collect your answers\n\nNo answers yet collected",
