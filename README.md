Available releases are:

- Textbook [Alpha version from 2021-2022](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/MOSAIC-Calculus-2021-2022) which was used while developing the course. You are unlikely to want this release unless you were involved in the course development that year.

## Repo organization notes

This repository is for the use only of the Project MOSAIC team. It contains only the student-facing HTML files for *MOSAIC Calculus*. The repo contains only the `docs/` directory from the source-code, which is in the `dtkaplan/MC2` account in GitHub. This repository is constructed by copying over the `docs/` directory from the source-code.
